   Introduction        Iran 's interest in nuclear technology dates back to the US Atoms for Peace program .                                                                               In the 1950s , the Shah initiated Iran 's nuclear research program and developed an ambitious plan to produce 23,000 MW from nuclear power by the end of the century .                                                                                                                                                                                                Early progress was not steady , and the nuclear program was stalled by the Islamic revolution in 1979 , then the eight - year war with Iraq through most of the 1980s .                                                                                                                                                 The program was revived later in the decade , when strategic interests began to drive the nuclear program .                                                                                                                    Under the Khomeini regime , Iran 's nuclear program steadily grew on all fronts and stages of the nuclear fuel cycle , with a particular emphasis on developing and strengthening indigenous capabilities .                                                                                                                                                                    Partly as a result of the shortcomings in the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) safeguards system -- which allowed the rapid development of the Iraqi nuclear program in the 1970s and North Korea 's in the 1990s to go largely undetected -- and partly by assessing Iran 's intentions , the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) have increased their scrutiny of Iran 's activities over the last several years .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The most alarming developments were revealed in 2002 - 03 , during which time Iran admitted to having construction plans for two enrichment facilities , a heavy water production plant , a fuel fabrication plant , and undertaken research into conversion and enrichment activities ( including centrifuges and possibly lasers ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On 19 August 2003 , Iran began testing a ten - machine cascade at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz with uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) .                                                                                                                          After announcing on 21 October 2003 that it would cooperate with the IAEA , Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT on 18 December .                                                                                                                      All Iran 's research activities in the recent past undoubtedly contribute to the future development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which in turn would enable Iran to weaponize without relying on outside assistance .                                                                                                                                                        History        Although Iran began developing its nuclear program in the 1950s , it was slow to progress until late in the 1960s , when the US - supplied 5 MW thermal research reactor ( TRR ) went online at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center ( TNRC ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In 1973 , spurred by an influx of oil revenues , the Shah of Iran embarked on an ambitious goal of modernizing the country and building its image abroad .                                                                                                      He did this by shifting the country 's budgets toward the military and the newly established Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) .                                                                                                      The Shah set his goal high : `` ... get , as soon as possible , 23,000 MW from nuclear power stations . ''                                                                                                          In 1968 , Iran signed the NPT in an effort to speed up its negotiations for nuclear agreements , particularly with the United States .                                                                                                                             In 1970 , the government ratified the NPT and its obligations went into force .                                                                                                In the five years that followed , Iran concluded several contracts for the construction of nuclear plants and the supply of nuclear fuel : with the United States in 1974 ; Germany in 1976 ; and France in 1977 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 1976 , Iran also purchased a stake in Eurodif 's ( the European consortium ) Tricastin uranium enrichment plant in France and purchased a stake in the RTZ uranium mine in Rossing , Namibia .                                                                                                                                                                  Also in 1976 , the government signed a $700 million contract to purchase uranium yellowcake from South Africa and sent Iranian technicians abroad for training in nuclear sciences .                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In addition to his grand plans for nuclear power , the Shah placed a great emphasis on establishing and developing a nuclear research program .                                                                                                                               Although the Shah had no specific plans to engage in research of uranium reprocessing or enrichment , the scientists at the AEOI 's newly equipped TNRC were reportedly given great discretion regarding the nature and direction of experiments conducted .                                                                                                                                                                                                   According to former head of AEOI , Akbar Etemad , the Shah 's interest in nuclear technology did not involve military applications , in fact the Shah `` considered it absurd , under the existing circumstances , to embark on anything else but a purely civilian program . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   However , according to recently revealed documents discovered in Tehran after the revolution , in the late 1970s Iran and Israel discussed a plan to modify Israel 's surface - to - surface Jericho missiles for use by Iran -- missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And , despite Akbar Etemad 's beliefs , the Western intelligence community had long suspected that the Shah 's nuclear scientists conducted research into military applications .                                                                                                                                                                   Suspected activities at the TNRC include nuclear weapons design , plutonium extraction and laser - enrichment research .                                                                                                                                      By the time of the Islamic Revolution in January 1979 , Iran 's nuclear program was considered one the most advanced in the Middle East .                                                                                                     In the immediate aftermath of the revolution , Iran 's ambitious nuclear program fell apart due to the initial opposition by the Khomeini government to nuclear technology and because of the exodus of many of Iran 's nuclear scientists .                                                                                                                                                              Additionally , the insufficiency of the existing electrical infrastructure and dwindling oil revenues contributed to the withdrawal of foreign suppliers from Iran and the abandonment of nuclear power agreements .                                                                                                                                                                                           Iran 's only nuclear power plants in 1979 were the two plants under construction at Bushehr , under contract with Germany 's Siemens .                                                                                                                                                The weapons research side of Iran 's nuclear activities seemed to have continued uninterrupted by the revolution , and received a major boost when a new nuclear research center opened at Isfahan in 1984 .                                                                                                                                                                                       From its inception , the revolutionary government was forced to face external challenges in addition to domestic instability .                                                         Invasion by Iraq and the loss of Iran 's powerful ally , the United States , must have contributed to Iran 's sense of political and military vulnerability .                                                                                    Eight years of war with Iraq , multiple bombings of the Bushehr reactor site , chemical attacks on its forces , missile strikes on its cities , and an overall drain on its resources would certainly have had a devastating effect on Iran .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In addition to feeling threatened by Iraq 's growing nuclear program , these attacks may explain why the Khomeini government ultimately resumed its efforts to continue Iran 's nuclear power program and strengthen its existing nuclear research program -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          As the Cold War ended , the strategic environment around Iran changed .                                                           After the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran , the United States withdrew its support from Iran , cut all nuclear cooperation agreements , and , in fact , supported Iraq during the war .                                                                                                                                                   China , North Korea , and , to a certain extent , Syria emerged as major suppliers of conventional arms to Iran .                                                                                             Help from China and North Korea , however , was not limited to conventional weaponry .                                                                By this time , Iran was shopping for a new bidder to complete the Bushehr project .                                                               The late 1980s saw a rise of several new potential exporters of nuclear assistance .                                                                       Pakistan and China signed long - term nuclear cooperation agreements with Iran in 1987 and 1990 , respectively .                                                                                          Accords with both countries involved training personnel , and in the case of China , the accord included an agreement to provide Iran with a 27 KW miniature neutron source reactor ( MNSR ) and two 300 MW Qinshan power reactors .                                                                                                                                                                  Western intelligence suspected that Pakistan , which many estimated had succeeded in manufacturing a nuclear bomb in 1986 , provided Iran with nuclear assistance .                                                                                                                                                                Reports in Western press and leaks from Western government and intelligence sources indicated that Pakistan had trained Iranian scientists in plutonium extraction and possibly gas centrifuge enrichment research .                                                                                                                                                                                 Training was most likely carried out under the direction of Abdul Qadeer Khan , former director of the Engineering Research Laboratories , later renamed the Dr . A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories ( Kahuta ) , where Pakistan 's nuclear weapons research and enrichment takes place .                                                                                                                                                                                                A.Q. Khan is widely regarded as the father of Pakistan 's nuclear bomb .                                                                                  The Soviet Union , traditionally an ally of Iraq , had also indicated an interest in cooperating with Iran .                                                                             In 1990 , the Soviet Union and Iran began negotiating over the completion of the Bushehr reactors and the supply of additional nuclear plants .                                                                                                                                                        In January 1995 , the Russian Federation formally announced that it would complete the construction of the Bushehr reactors and signed an agreement with Iran to build three additional reactors at the site .                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Since the signing of these agreements , the United States has continuously expressed its opposition to the Bushehr deal because of fears that the deal could provide Iran with knowledge and technology to support a nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                                                        Despite many technical delays ( misfit of original Siemens equipment with Russian technology ) and efforts by the United States to stall the project , frequently by lobbying the Russia government for the cancellation of the deal , most notably during the Gore - Chernomyrdin Commission meetings , the facility is nearing completion .                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Over the years , the United States has successfully blocked several of Iran 's nuclear agreements , such as those with Argentina ( uranium enrichment and heavy water production facilities ) , China ( plutonium - producing research reactor , two power reactors and a uranium conversion plant ) , and Russia ( heavy water production plant ) .                                                                                                                                                       In 1995 , it became evident that Iran may be pursuing nuclear weapons through another track : by procuring dual - use items from Western firms .                                                                                                                                                  The United States also learned that Iran and Russia concluded a secret protocol stipulating , among other things , construction of a gas centrifuge enrichment facility .                                                                                                                                                 The fear was that Iran might learn how to construct a similar clandestine facility and then produce weapons - grade uranium undetected .                                                                                                                                                 The United States then imposed extensive sanctions on Iran and successfully pressured Russia and other potential suppliers , mostly in Europe , to halt exports of sensitive dual - use nuclear technology to Iran , such as high - voltage switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon and specialized remote manipulators designed to handle heavy volumes of radioactive material and possibly intended for a uranium or plutonium reprocessing plant .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In mid - 2002 , a Paris - based opposition group , the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) , revealed the existence of two previously unknown facilities -- a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak .                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Following the discovery of substantial reserves of uranium ore at Saghand , Yazd province , Iran announced that it was developing a nuclear power plan that would rely solely on indigenous resources .                                                                                                                                                                                                               These two events greatly alarmed the Western intelligence community .                                        An enrichment and heavy water production capability along with domestic resources of uranium would significantly contribute to the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .                                                                                                                     Recent Developments and Current Status                Upon visiting suspected facilities in February 2003 , and with new declarations by Iran , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concluded that several sensitive technology facilities are either operational , under construction , or planned .                                                                                                                                                                                                        The IAEA raised questions regarding possible enrichment activities at the workshops of the Kalaye Electric Company relating to production of centrifuge components .                                                                                                                                                             Additionally , Iran admitted to having imported from China 1.8 tons of nuclear material ( UF6 , UF4 and UO2 ) used to manufacture uranium metal , which is essential in weapons production .                                                                                                                                                                                                During its meetings with IAEA officials in August 2003 , Iran for the first time provided evidence of its technical violations of the NPT by revealing that in the 1990s , it had carried out 113 uranium conversion experiments involving the production of uranium metal from imported UF4 and the production of UF4 from imported UO2 , as well as laboratory - scale experiments in the 1980s involving the production of heavy water .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        During the IAEA inspection in June 2003 , environmental samples that were taken from chemical traps of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz revealed the presence of highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) .                                                                                                                                     Short of declaring Iran in violation of the NPT , the IAEA Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei stated , `` Iran has failed to meet its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement '' and criticized Iran for not being transparent with the construction of its nuclear - related facilities and import of nuclear material .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The IAEA Board of Governors has imposed on Iran a 31 October 2003 deadline to resolve all outstanding issues and to provide full and complete declaration of its nuclear material and nuclear activities , specifically Iran 's enrichment program and past conversion experiments .                                                                                                                                                                                        It further called on Iran to suspend all enrichment activities and sign an Additional Protocol .                                                                                                         In an effort to diffuse the tense relations between Iran and the IAEA and to preserve the sanctity of the nonproliferation regime , foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany secured Iran 's consent to cooperation with the IAEA ahead of the 31 October deadline .                                                                                                                                                                       Faced with probability of sanctions and international isolation in case of noncompliance with the IAEA 's demands , Iran announced on 21 October 2003 that it will cooperate with the IAEA with full transparency and disclosure , sign the Additional Protocol and commence its ratification procedures , and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities , albeit for an `` interim period . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And finally , on 18 December 2003 , Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT , thus allowing snap inspections of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA experts .                                                                                                                                            Ali Akbar Salehi , the outgoing Iranian representative to the IAEA , signed on behalf of Iran , and Director - General ElBaradei signed for the IAEA .                                                                                                        Iran appears to be dangerously close to developing an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle , which would in turn enable it to develop a nuclear bomb without much reliance on outside help .                                                                                                                                Comparison with the other nuclear axis member North Korea is tempting , but inappropriate .                                                            Iran is motivated by its aspirations for political , religious , and military leadership in the region , unlike North Korea , for whom mere survival appears to be the priority .                                                                                                                             Iran has traditionally felt insecure among its neighbors , first vis - a - vis Iraq , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological threat , and now that the Hussein regime is gone , the growing presence and influence of the United States .                                                                                                                                                                                               Additionally , the constant threat of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , mostly perpetuated by Iran 's technocrats , government officials and the pro - nuclear lobby , adds to Iran 's perceived concerns and justifies it to the domestic audience the need to develop nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                    Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .                                                                                                  First , an unlikely but not impossible development would be an emergence of a domestic opposition to nuclear weapons , potentially within President Khatami 's reformist government .                                                                                                               A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .                                                                                                                                                                               A third approach might be a regional effort on the part of Arab states to pressure Iran to abandon sensitive technology and questionable activities in favor of a weapons - free zone in the Middle East .                                                                                                                                                                                                            Since Iran signed the Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards on 18 December 2003 , the Protocol provided inspectors from the IAEA with greater access within Iran and the option to carry out intrusive inspections at Iran 's nuclear facilities .                                                                                                                                                           Subsequent IAEA inspections in Iran revealed a wealth of new information related to the development and scale of Iran 's nuclear program .                                                                                                                                                       Iran is generally viewed as having been forthcoming and helpful to these IAEA efforts , although this cooperation has clearly not been absolute .                                                                                                                      Indeed , on 18 June 2004 , IAEA board members voted to reprimand Iran for not providing the agency with more timely and comprehensive support .                                                                                                        Specifically , Iran was rebuked for postponing IAEA visits to a number of locations related to Iran 's P - 2 centrifuge enrichment program , which had been scheduled to take place in March 2004 .                                                                                                                                                                                                          The IAEA also criticized Iran 's lack of forthrightness about its possession of P - 2 design drawings and other related research , and information regarding its manufacturing and mechanical testing activities , all of which was omitted from Iran 's 21 October 2003 declaration to the agency .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The IAEA called on Iran to `` be proactive in taking all necessary steps on an urgent basis to resolve all outstanding issues '' , including those related to contamination by low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) and HEU , as well as the limited production of polonium - 210 and plutonium .                                                                                                                                                                                                        Concurrently , the United States along with some other IAEA board members has continued to maintain that Iran is pursuing an underground nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                  And while this claim has not yet been substantiated by IAEA inspectors , proponents argue that Iran has violated the NPT and that the country 's nuclear file should , in turn , be referred to the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) for its review .                                                                                                                                                                           El - Baradei is , however , weary of pursuing such a hard line against Iran , as he fears that exerting too much pressure may cause Iran to opt out of the NPT altogether .                                                                                                                    Responding to the barrage of critics who insist that Iran 's illicit intentions are obvious , El - Baradei has pointed to the continued absence of a `` smoking gun '' and the fundamental shortcomings of attempts to concretely assess Iran 's programmatic goals without such evidence .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   As he stated in July 2004 , `` We are not God .                                                      We can not read intentions . ''                                         For its part , Iran continues to assert that it pursues a nuclear program with only peaceful applications , while El - Baradei is steadfast in his belief that the situation may be resolved diplomatically .                                                                                                                                                             In addition , Russia remains unequivocally opposed to United Nations ' sanctions against Iran , especially given the absence of evidence to bolster claims about illicit activities .                                                                                                                                       Russia has also supported Iran 's disclosure efforts , despite Russian President Vladimir Putin 's November 2003 charge that Iran acted in bad faith by failing to fully comply with IAEA inspections .                                                                                                                                                                            Facilities        Overview        Iran is rapidly constructing nuclear facilities to achieve its goal of having an indigenous fuel cycle capability .                                                                                                                              Iran 's nuclear program operates numerous facilities throughout the country , including the Nuclear Research Center in Tehran , ( TNRC ) , the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center ( ENTC ) , Nuclear Research Center for Agriculture and Medicine , and the Beneficiation and Hydrometalurgical Research Center ( BHRC ) .                                                                                                                                                                                   In addition to these , there have been new revelations about Iran 's centrifuge enrichment program located in Natanz and heavy water related activity in Arak .                                                                                                                                                                   Finally , the Bushehr nuclear reactor , when completed , will be Iran 's first nuclear power plant when it goes on - line in the coming year .                                                                                                                                      Within the next 10 years , there will likely be at least one , possibly more , power reactors built in Iran .                                                                                                               The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) is the government agency that oversees Iran 's nuclear program , and is one of the few agencies in Iran that reports directly to the president .                                                                                                                                          It was created in 1973 to oversee a 23,000 MW nuclear power program in Iran .                                                                               However , the organization has since undergone several revisions in mission and structure .                                                                   It is unclear how many people presently work at AEOI .                                                                  According to international observers of AEOI , the organization once had 4,500 employees .                                                                                 After the Islamic Revolution , however , many leading nuclear scientists left the country , and in the 1990 , the AEOI reportedly employed `` around 200 scientists and 2,000 personnel engaged in nuclear research . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                 Research and development of the nuclear fuel cycle has been highlighted as a key function of the AEOI .                                                                           The organization consists of five separate divisions : Research , Nuclear Power Plant , Nuclear Fuel Production , Nuclear Regulatory Authority , and Planning , Education , and Parliamentary Affairs .                                                                              Two of these , Research and Fuel Production , are essential to develop a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .                                                                                        The responsibility of the Research Division is to plan and guide all nuclear - related research projects and to develop peaceful nuclear technologies in Iran .                                                                                                                 It does so by coordinating activities of several nuclear research centers , most notably the TNRC and ENTC .                                                                                                The TNRC operates , among other things , a 5 MW research reactor .                                                                            The ENTC is home to a miniature neutron source reactor ( MNSR ) , other research reactors , and subcritical assemblies .                                                                                                             The TNRC and ENTC manage various departments , facilities , and laboratories .                                                     Over the years , these laboratories have conducted research into conversion ( a hexafluoride plant in Esfahan and at the Jabr Ibn Hayan Multipurpose Laboratories - JHL ) , enrichment , and reprocessing ( analysis and separation experiments using US - supplied hot cells , and radioisotope production at the TNRC ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Nuclear Fuel Production Division ( NFPD ) of the AEOI is responsible for research and development of uranium exploration , mining , milling , conversion , fuel production , and waste management .                                                                                                              The NFPD maintains facilities in Yazd province to explore and exploit uranium deposits .                                                                      The Nuclear Fuel Research and Production Center in Esfahan houses various chemical , engineering , and metallurgical laboratories , the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor ( MNSR ) and the zero power reactor .                                                                                           The Benefication and Hydrometallurgical Research Center ( BHRC ) operates facilities involved in the production of yellowcake .                                                                                                     AEOI 's activities and facilities have been tied to several universities .                                                                                             Faculty from the Physics and Nuclear Science Department at Amir Kabir University in Tehran have worked closely with various AEOI components , including the Nuclear Fusion Department , the JHL laboratory , the Laser Research Center , the TNRC , and the Nuclear Power Plant Division .                                                                                                                    Additionally , personnel from Saghand University cooperate with AEOI staff to conduct research in mining and milling of uranium at BHRC laboratories .                                                                                                                      After numerous allegations by opposition groups and Western governments , Iran announced that it was constructing several new facilities .                                                                                                                                                       The most important of these are the Natanz uranium enrichment plant ( comprising a pilot - and commercial - scale fuel enrichment facility ) , a fuel fabrication plant at Esfahan , a uranium metal purification and casting laboratory , and a 40 MW heavy water research reactor ( IR - 40 ) in Arak .                                                                                                                                                                                                               The presence of these facilities confirms Iran 's growing determination to achieve a full nuclear fuel cycle .                                                                                         Iran claims that all its facilities are necessary for a peaceful and self - sufficient nuclear program .                                                                                               However , analysts question the need for several components , particularly those in which the feedstock or product is either provided by a supplier country ( fuel production plant ) or that do not fit in the general scheme of Iran 's overall nuclear program ( uranium metal laboratory ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                        These facilities and Iran 's overall program are currently undergoing close scrutiny by the international community and will likely remain so until controversy over the facilities ' purpose and capability can be resolved .
