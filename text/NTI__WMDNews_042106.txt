But , Gov . Donald Carcieri , Providence Mayor David Cicilline and others told Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine and Rhode Island Sen .

The U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has no effective way to screen or inspect these trash trucks as they enter Michigan , and the potential consequences of this security gap are immense .                                                                                                                                                                    The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) recently completed a study , conducted in response to a request I [ Carl Levin ] made with Senator Debbie Stabenow and Rep . John Dingell that bluntly acknowledges the security risk these trucks pose .                                                                                                                                                                                                         The DHS report describes the three methods currently used by customs officials to inspect the trucks : a Radiation Portal Monitor to detect the presence of radiation , a Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System screening that creates an image similar to an X-ray , and physical inspections .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screening methods are nearly useless for screening trash , however , due to the density and lack of uniform content of trash shipments .                                                        The X-ray image produced is nothing more than a large amorphous black mass. I fear that for every trash truck caught carrying contraband into Michigan , many more get through undetected with drugs , medical waste or other illegal material .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Ignoring the possibility that these trucks could be used by terrorists to transport biological or chemical weapons is irresponsible .                                                                                                                                          It is now unequivocally clear that these trash shipments are a weak link in our security.
