   Nuclear Capabilities                  Methodology       Countries developing clandestine nuclear weapons programs usually go to great lengths to conceal information about these programs from the outside world .                                                                                                                                               Therefore , obtaining reliable open source information on such programs is very challenging .                                                                                                        The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .                                                                                                                            Nonetheless , countries suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs are the subject of intense scrutiny by nonproliferation analysts , intelligence agencies , and other observers .                                                                                                                                                                                 Gradually , a fuzzy picture emerges from the analysis , albeit with some gaps in understanding .                                                                        The resulting analysis can set bounds on the uncertainties , while producing a range of estimates of the country 's capabilities .                                                                                                                 Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Technical analysis of clandestine programs is based on the widely known physical and engineering aspects of nuclear materials and weapons , which enable estimates of capabilities based on fragmentary and uncertain information , as follows .                                                                                                                                                                                           Nuclear weapons programs require specialized materials , facilities , equipment , and training in order to produce the raw material for weapons -- either highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) or plutonium -- and then to fabricate explosive devices using this fissile material .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Weapons programs can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) production capabilities , or they can rely on foreign supplies and technologies .                                                                                                                                                                                  Virtually all weapons programs use some foreign inputs , if only technical information culled from scientific and engineering sources .                                                                                                                           However , all countries known to have successfully acquired nuclear weapons have done so primarily on the basis of indigenously produced fissile material .                                                                                                                                             A plutonium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , process it into reactor fuel , transform the isotopic content of the fuel by `` burning '' it in a reactor , extract plutonium from the spent fuel , form the plutonium into the core of a fission - implosion weapon , and develop and test high explosives used to initiate fission .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Although technically sub - optimal , even reactor - grade plutonium can be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                   A uranium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , and to enrich it to weapons - grade or near - weapons - grade ( the Hiroshima bomb used less - than - weapons - grade uranium ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     An advanced weapons program would require the capability to manufacture tritium , a radioactive gas that can be used to enhance the explosive power of nuclear weapons , for fabrication of boosted - yield weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     While countries may seek to develop all of these capabilities on an independent , indigenous basis , they can and often do seek some inputs from foreign sources .                                                                                                                                                                                 For example , they may purchase raw or milled uranium ore from abroad , and then use indigenous facilities to enrich it to weapons - grade material .                                                                                                                                                                                                Determining how many nuclear weapons a country can produce with a given amount of fissile material requires knowing the technological sophistication of the country and the explosive yield of the weapons .                                                                                                                                                                      These specifications in North Korea are unknown .                     Based on data supplied by the de jure nuclear weapons states , the IAEA Safeguards Division defines quantities of concern as 8kg of plutonium and 25kg of HEU .                                                                                                                                         However , sophisticated nuclear weapons reportedly use as little as 3 - 4kg of plutonium and/or 15 - 20kg of HEU .                                                                                           The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that a country with a `` high technical capability '' could require as little as 1kg of weapons - grade plutonium or 2.5kg HEU to produce a one kiloton bomb .                                                                                                                                                                                                       The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used low - level nuclear weapons technology .                                                                                            The Hiroshima bomb , for example , employed about 50kg of 80% enriched uranium .                                                                                           In the case of North Korea , determining the status of its nuclear weapons program is especially difficult .                                                                                             As an extremely isolated and secretive state , North Korea provides few signals of the existence -- let alone the extent -- of its nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                Key data sources for DPRK include defector testimony , which may be unreliable given possibility of deliberate disinformation by double agents and defectors exaggerating what they know , and unclassified estimates by US intelligence agencies , which may have certain biases based on national interest , worst - case expectations , domestic politics , etc. Also , most estimates do not rely on original texts in Korean , which may introduce some errors due to translation issues .
