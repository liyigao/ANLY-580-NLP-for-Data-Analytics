   Introduction       The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 left the Russian Federation with the bulk of the massive Soviet weapons of mass destruction complex .                                                                              This legacy has allowed Russia to retain its great power status even as its economy has collapsed , but the burden of supporting this oversized complex has strained the Russian political and economic system .                                                                                                                 Russia 's nuclear and missile capabilities presupposes its crucial role in arms control and nonproliferation , while the remnants of chemical and biological weapons programs pose major environmental and proliferation threats .                                                                                                                                                              Nuclear       The Soviet nuclear weapon program began during World War II and culminated in a successful atomic bomb test in 1949 .                                                                                                                         Russia , as the successor of the Soviet Union , is a nuclear weapon state party to the Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .                                                                                According to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council , by 1991 , the Soviet Union had approximately 35,000 weapons in its stockpile , down from a peak in 1986 of approximately 45,000 .                                                                                                                                              Russia is estimated to now have around 20,000 nuclear weapons , although total stockpile size is uncertain because there is no accurate count of tactical nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                        However , in 2002 Russia declared it will eliminate its tactical nuclear weapons by the end of 2004 .                                                                                                       Under the START I Treaty , the Russian nuclear arsenal has been reduced to approximately 7,000 strategic warheads .                                                                                            The START II Treaty , which was declared non - binding in June 2002 , would have reduced this number to between 3,000 and 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads .                                                                                              The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty ( Treaty of Moscow ) requires Russia to reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012 .                                                                                                                                                Russia inherited a massive nuclear weapons production complex and large stocks of weapons grade fissile material .                                                                                                                         It is estimated that Russia has between 735 and 1,365 metric tons ( t ) of weapons grade - equivalent highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) and between 106 and 156 t of military - use plutonium .                                                                                                                                                                                                 Biological       The Soviet Union ratified the BWC in 1975 .                                            Nevertheless , the Soviet Union violated the treaty by secretly operating a massive offensive BW program until it dissolved in 1991 .                                                                                                                                   The Soviet BW arsenal included the causative agents of anthrax , smallpox , plague , tularemia , glanders , and hemorrhagic fever .                                                                                               In wartime , formulated agents would have been loaded into a variety of delivery systems , including aerial bombs and ballistic missile warheads .                                                                                                                                                                  Soviet BW scientists also researched , developed , and produced anti - crop and anti - livestock agents .                                                                                                              Although the U.S. government believes that the BW agent stockpiles have been destroyed , activities that contravene the BWC may continue at a few military biological facilities in Russia .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Soviet Union also established a so - called anti - plague system , whose primary objective was to control endemic diseases and prevent the importation of exotic pathogens that could threaten crops , animals , and humans .                                                                                                                                                                                 In the late 1960s , however , the system also was tasked with defending the USSR against biological attacks .                                                                                                The anti - plague system continues in today 's Russia .                                                    There are reports that some countries , including Iran , have attempted to hire Russian BW specialists to help them acquire biological weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                       Chemical        During the Cold War , and afterwards , the Soviet Union had the world 's largest arsenal of chemical weapons , including artillery shells , bombs , and missiles that contained choking agents ( phosgene ) , nerve agents ( sarin , soman , and VX ) , and blister agents ( mustard , lewisite , and mustard - lewisite mixture ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             There have been allegations that the Soviet Union developed a new class of nerve agent ( Novichok ) , estimated to be 5 - 10 times more toxic than VX .                                                                                                                                                                         Russia inherited the declared Soviet stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of CW munitions and agents stored in bulk .                                                                                                                          In November 1997 , Russia ratified the CWC , but financial and other difficulties have impeded the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , so it is far behind the timetable specified in the treaty .                                                                                                                                                                     Missile                 Russia inherited most of the Soviet missile complex , although significant portions are located in Ukraine .                                                                                                        Russia has the capability to produce highly sophisticated liquid - and solid - fueled missiles of all ranges .                                                                                                                      The RS -12M2 Topol-M ( NATO designation SS-27 ) intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) has been developed for silo basing and mobile basing model is under development .                                                                                                                                             Although the possibility of deploying a MIRVed variant of the SS-27 has also been discussed in the past , no steps in that direction appear to have been taken yet .                                                                                                                                   In the meantime , Russia continues to extend service lives of existing types of MIRVed ICBMs .                                                                                While no sea - launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) is currently in production , Russia is developing a new SLBM called the Bulava , which is to be deployed in the existing Typhoon class submarines and in the future in a new class of ballistic missile submarines currently under construction .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is planned that in the future a modification of Bulava will also be deployed in silos as a MIRVed ICBM .                                                                                       There are also plans to start production of an upgraded SS-N-23 variant , designated Sineva , and the Air Force reportedly began to receive a new type of strategic cruise missile .                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Reports of exports and leakage of Russian missile technology to countries such as Iran , India , China , Libya , and North Korea have led to concerns that Russia is contravening its obligations as a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
