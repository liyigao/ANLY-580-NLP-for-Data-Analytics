   Friday, February 2, 2007               Work Advances at Iranian Uranium Enrichment Site                                                                                    Iran has begun preliminary work to install thousands of centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facility as a dispute roiled over whether the International Atomic Energy Agency was receiving the access it wants to monitor the site , wire services reported today ( see GSN , Feb. 1 ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Hundreds of workers `` were working feverishly '' to place piping and wiring in Iran 's underground enrichment facility at Natanz , said a diplomat accredited to the agency .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The work is preparation for Iran 's plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at the site , but so far no centrifuges have been emplaced , according to the Associated Press .                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Two smaller `` cascades '' of centrifuges have been operating in above-ground buildings at the site since last year , and a smaller set of machinery has been tested underground since November without using any uranium gas , according to AP ( George Jahn , Associated Press / Houston Chronicle , Feb. 2 ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The nuclear agency had hoped to monitor the larger centrifuge cascade with cameras , but Iranian officials were `` not allowing the IAEA to install the cameras inside the cascade halls in Natanz and are causing further delays in the inspectors ' activity , '' a diplomat who closely monitors the agency said yesterday .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            `` The Iranians are now willing to accept the installation of cameras only outside the cascade halls , which will not enable the IAEA to monitor the entire uranium enrichment process , '' the diplomat said .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        `` This way the IAEA will only be able to see the crates that are taken into the hall and the workers coming and going . ''                                                                                                                                                                           `` Uranium enrichment will nevertheless proceed inside the halls uninterrupted and unmonitored by the international community , '' the diplomat added ( Michael Adler , Agence France-Presse/Yahoo! News , Feb. 1 ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                For its part , Iran today denied that it prevented the agency from positioning cameras , but did not specifically address the location of the cameras .                                                                                                                                              `` The installation of cameras has taken place in Natanz .                                                                         We have cooperated with the IAEA based on the safeguards and we will continue to do so in the framework of cooperation and treaties , '' said a senior Iranian diplomat in Tehran .                                                                                                                                                                                                                           `` The installation of monitoring systems and surveillance is taking place correctly and in the past days , the monitoring system has been strengthened , and there is no problem regarding this issue between Iran and the agency , '' the official added ( Reuters / New York Times , Feb. 2 ) .
