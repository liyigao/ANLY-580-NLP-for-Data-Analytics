   Introduction        China possesses nuclear weapons , a range of ballistic missile capabilities , and the ability to develop chemical and biological weapons .                                                                                                                                                            A key uncertainty is how ongoing military modernization efforts will ultimately reshape China 's strategic nuclear capabilities , but U.S. deployments of missile defenses are likely to be a key variable .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Serious concerns remain about China 's proliferation of ballistic missile technology and its ability to control chemical items that could be used in the production of chemical weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Improved export control laws and enforcement have addressed many ( but not all ) concerns about nuclear and chemical weapons - related proliferation .                                                                                                                                                                                                      Nuclear        China 's nuclear weapons program began in 1955 and culminated in a successful nuclear test in 1964 .                                                                                                                                               Since then , China has conducted 45 nuclear tests , including tests of thermonuclear weapons and a neutron bomb .                                                                                                                                                            The series of nuclear tests in 1995 - 96 prior to China 's signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) may have resulted in a smaller and lighter warhead design for the new generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) now under development .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              China is estimated to have about 400 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , and stocks of fissile material sufficient to produce a much larger arsenal .                                                                                                                                                                                                                China joined the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in 1984 and acceded to the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state .                                                                                                                                                                                                     China provided nuclear reactors and technology to several countries in the 1980s and early 1990s , including design information and fissile material that reportedly helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Since the early 1990s , China has improved its export controls , including the promulgation of regulations on nuclear and nuclear dual - use exports and has pledged to halt exports of nuclear technology to un - safeguarded facilities .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In 2002 China ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol , the first and only nuclear weapons state to do so .                                                                                                                                                                                           Biological                 China is a party to most of the major international agreements regulating biological weapons , including the Geneva Protocol and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC or BTWC ) .                                                                                                                                                                                    China is not , however , a member of the Australia Group ( AG ) , a voluntary supply - side export control regime focused on chemical and biological weapons , though the issuance of new export control regulations in 2002 has put Beijing 's export control policy fully in line with that of the AG .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           While China has publicly declared to be consistently in compliance with the BTWC , past U.S. government reports have alleged that China not only has a small - scale offensive biological weapons program , but has also transferred controlled biological weapons - related items to nations of proliferation concern such as Iran .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Such transfers have resulted in numerous U.S. nonproliferation sanctions being imposed on Chinese entities .                                                                                                                         Chemical        China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in December 1996 , declaring two former chemical weapons ( CW ) production facilities that may have produced mustard gas and Lewisite .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Since 1997 , China has hosted 14 on - site inspections by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) .                                                                                                                                                                        Although China claims that it no longer possesses any CW stockpiles , the U.S. government believes that China has not revealed the full scope of its program .                                                                                                                                                                                                             China has signed a bilateral agreement with Japan to destroy CW that Japan abandoned in Chinese territory during World War II .                                                                                                                   Missile                 China has produced and deployed a wide range of ballistic missiles , ranging from short - range missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) .                                                                                                                                                                                      China 's missiles are operated by the Second Artillery Corps , and include about 650 DF -11 ( M-11 ) and DF-15 ( M-9 ) missiles opposite Taiwan ; several dozens of DF -3 , DF -4 , and DF -21 medium - range missiles that can reach Japan , India , and Russia ; and 18-24 DF -5 ICBMs that can reach the United States and Europe .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A transition is currently underway from relatively inaccurate , liquid - fueled , silo / cave - based missiles ( DF-3 , DF -4 , DF -5 ) to more accurate , solid - fueled , mobile missiles ( DF-11 , DF-15 , and DF-21 , and a new ICBM [ the DF-31 ] and SLBM [ the JL-2 ] , which are currently under development ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        China is replacing its older DF-5 missiles with new DF -5A variants , which may eventually be equipped with multiple warheads .                                                                                                                                                                                                             A key question is how U.S. deployment of ballistic missile defense ( formerly known as theater and national missile defense ) will affect the pace and scope of Chinese strategic modernization .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chinese missile exports have been a problem for more than a decade .                                                                                                 China transferred 36 DF-3 medium - range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 , and supplied Pakistan with 34 M-11 short - range missiles in 1992 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                           China has provided technology and expertise to the missile programs of several countries , including Pakistan , Iran , and North Korea .                                                                                                                                                              China has not joined the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , but has pledged to abide by its main parameters .                                                                                                                                             In November 2000 , China promised not to assist any country in the development of nuclear - capable ballistic missiles .                                                                                                                                                                         In August 2002 , China issued regulations and a control list restricting the export of missiles and missile technology .                                                                                                                                                                                     Since 2004 , China has been engaged in consultation with the MTCR ; however , its application for membership has so far not been successful and suspicions , especially in the United States , about Chinese missile technology transfers remain .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                China 's development of anti - satellite ( ASAT ) capabilities has also raised concerns about China 's missile and related military space program .                                                                                                                                                             On 11 January 2007 , China successfully carried out a test of a direct ascent anti - satellite ( ASAT ) weapon , by using a ballistic missile to destroy an aging weather satellite in orbit approximately 500 miles above the Earth 's surface .
