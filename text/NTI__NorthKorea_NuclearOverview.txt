   Nuclear Overview                  North Korea has joined , violated , and withdrawn from the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in the course of activities apparently dedicated to the production of nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                  On 23 April 2003 in Beijing , North Korean Deputy Foreign Minster Li Gun ( Lee Gu ( n ) reportedly told U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                        Li made the statement during trilateral talks between delegations from the United States , China , and North Korea .                                                                             On 10 February 2005 , the North Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed Li 's statement by announcing that Pyongyang had manufactured nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                            North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test , but in early May 2005 , press reports indicated that U.S. satellite imagery had detected signs that North Korea could be preparing for a nuclear test to be conducted in June .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        As of May 2005 , there had been three rounds of six - party talks in Beijing .                                                                             The six parties include China , Japan , North Korea , Russia , South Korea and the United States .                                                                 The six parties have agreed to hold working - level talks , and all sides have stated they have the ultimate goal of a non - nuclear Korean peninsula .                                                                                                                                           However , in February 2005 , Pyongyang announced that it was suspending indefinitely its participation in the six - party process until the the United States chanegd its `` hostile policy towards North Korea . ''                                                                                                                                                         Many analysts now believe the talks are dead , and in early May 2005 there were reports that Washington and Tokyo were preparing to refer the issue to the UN Security Council .                                                                                                                                                                                       On 12 May 2003 , North Korea announced that the bilateral `` Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula '' signed with South Korea on 20 January 1992 was no longer valid because of `` U.S. actions '' [ Note : the U.S. was not a signatory ] .                                                                                                                                                                                         Under the agreement , North and South Korea pledged not to produce nuclear weapons , not to reprocess plutonium , and not to enrich uranium .                                                                                                                                                              Under the Agreed Framework of October 1994 , Pyongyang also agreed to fulfill its commitments under the joint declaration .                                                       On 10 January 2003 , North Korea notified the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and the UN Security Council that Pyongyang was withdrawing from the NPT , and that the withdrawal would be effective the next day .                                                                                                                                                               The treaty requires 90 - day notice before a withdrawal , but North Korea claims this is not necessary since Pyongyang already declared its intention to withdraw in 1993 , only to `` suspend its intention withdraw ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   89 days later .                         The NPT withdrawal swiftly followed a December 2002 announcement that North Korea was lifting the freeze on its nuclear program , in response to the U.S. decision to suspend heavy fuel oil ( HFO ) shipments under the Agreed Framework .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pyongyang said it was lifting the freeze to generate electricity to compensate for the loss of HFO supplies , and North Korean technicians were able to remove seals and disable monitoring cameras at nuclear facilities in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun within a matter of days .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The IAEA 's ability to directly monitor activities at the Yo ( ngbyo ( n nuclear complex was completely lost in late December 2002 when North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors who had been monitoring the freeze .                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that North Korea has one or two nuclear bombs that were assembled with plutonium reprocessed between 1989 and 1991 .                                                                                                                                                 If so , it is unclear if these devices have been `` weaponized '' or are small enough to be mated with delivery systems ; the location of any such weapons is unknown .                                                                                                                                                        Furthermore , a plutonium bomb would have to be tested before North Korea could use it with confidence .                                                                                                                           However , some analysts speculate that North Korean scientists were present during Pakistan 's nuclear tests in May 1998 , and that Pyongyang could have obtained a tested bomb design from Islamabad or from Pakistani scientists without government approval .                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In the spring of 2003 , US intelligence detected activities around the Radiochemisty Laboratory , a reprocessing facility in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun , that indicate North Korea was probably reprocessing the 8,000 spent fuel rods that had been in a temporary storage pond .                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In September 2003 , a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said that North Korea had completed the reprocessing of this spent fuel , which would give North Korea enough plutonium for about four to six nuclear bombs .                                                                                                                                                                                     In January 2004 , a delegation of American private citizens confirmed that the cannisters in the temporary storage pond were empty .                                                                                                               There are also concerns about North Korea 's suspected highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) program , which is a different path to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                              In the summer of 2002 , US intelligence reportedly discovered new evidence about transfers of HEU technology and/or materials from Pakistan in exchange for ballistic missiles .                                                                                                                                                                             In October 2002 , a delegation led by James Kelly , US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs , visited Pyongyang and notified North Korean officials that the United States was aware of Pyongyang 's HEU development program .                                                                                                                                                                                                         Compared to plutonium - production facilities , the type of HEU production facilities that the DPRK may be developing would be difficult to detect , and therefore , it is difficult to accurately assess the program 's stage of development .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In early 2004 , Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr . A. Q. Khan revealed that he had sold gas - centrifuge technology to North Korea , Libya and Iran .                                                                                                                                                                     Libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions and is cooperating with the IAEA and the United States , which has revealed much about Khan 's network .                                                                                                                           In April 2003 , Egyptian customs officials intercepted 22 tons of aluminum tubing from Germany , which would be enough for about 100 - 200 centrifuges .                                                                                                                                                 In the spring of 2004 , it was reported that Khan visited North Korea and was shown three nuclear devices .                                                                                         However , the report lacks details , and its contents have not been confirmed .                                                      History        North Korea first became embroiled with nuclear politics during the Korean War .                                                                                         Although nuclear weapons were never used in Korea , American political leaders and military commanders threatened to use nuclear weapons to end the Korean War on terms favorable to the United States .                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In 1958 , the United States deployed nuclear weapons to South Korea for the first time , and the weapons remained there until President George Bush ordered their withdrawal in 1991 .                                                                                                                                                                           North Korean government statements and media reports often cite a `` nuclear threat from the United States , '' and continue to claim that the United States has about 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea .                                                                                                                                                                                                 There is no reason , however , to believe that this allegation is true .                                                                     There are different schools of thought on the motivations behind Pyongyang 's nuclear weapons program .                                                                                               Those who believe North Korea is a revisionist state argue that Pyongyang 's nuclear motivations constitute a serious external threat .                                                                                                                                    This school of thought has ample evidence to support its claims : North Korea 's initiation of the Korean War , acts of terrorism , forward - deployed military forces , a constitution that states that the DPRK is the sole legitimate government for all of Korea , and Korean Workers' Party bylaws calling for a `` completion of the revolution in the south . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Many analysts also argue that Pyongyang 's record of exporting ballistic missiles indicates that North Korea would also be willing to sell nuclear materials , technology , or complete nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                      On the other hand , some people believe North Korea is a state satisfied with the status quo and that it seeks peaceful coexistence with South Korea and the international community .                                                                                                                                                              Proponents of this school often argue that North Korea 's nuclear motivations are defensive in nature and designed to deter external threats to the DPRK .                                                                                                                     Evidence to support this argument includes the July 4 North - South Joint Communiquï¿½ of 1972 ; the Agreement on Reconciliation , Nonaggression , and Exchanges and Cooperation between North and South Korea of 1991 ( the so-called `` Basic Agreement '' ) ; the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of 1991 ; the summit meeting of 2000 ; the Agreed Framework with the United States ; and reunification proposals that would recognize `` two systems '' for the north and south .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               However , critics argue that Pyongyang 's behavior is inconsistent and that this evidence is not credible .                                                                                        Regardless of North Korean motivations toward South Korea and the United States , Pyongyang 's record of exporting ballistic missiles and missile production technology indicates that North Korea could also be willing to sell nuclear materials , technology , or even complete nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In the early 1950s , North Korea began establishing the institutional base to train the human resources for its nuclear development program .                                                                                                                                                                                  The Atomic Energy Research Institute was established along with the Academy of Sciences in December 1952 , but the nuclear program did not begin its take - off until North Korea established cooperative agreements with the Soviet Union .                                                                                                                                                                              Pyongyang signed the founding charter of the Soviet Union 's Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in February 1956 , and began to send scientists and technicians there for training shortly thereafter .                                                                                                                                                                      In 1959 , North Korea and the USSR signed an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy that included a provision for Soviet help to establishment a nuclear research complex in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun , North P'yo ( ng 'an Province .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In the early 1960s , the Soviet Union provided extensive technical assistance while North Korea constructed its Yo ( ngbyo ( n Nuclear Research Center , which included the installation of a Soviet IRT- 2000 Nuclear Research Reactor , and other facilities ( see Yo ( ngbyo ( n Nuclear Research Center ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The small research reactor has been used to produce radioisotopes and to train personnel .                                                                                                                          The cabinet and the Academy of Sciences were given operational and administrative oversight of the nuclear facilities , but ultimate control of the program and decisions over weapons development belonged to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung .                                                                                                                                                                          The program appeared to begin as a peaceful one , but whatever Kim 's original intentions , the Cuban Missile Crisis may have prompted initiation of a dedicated nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                      Indigenous Development         Kim Il Sung appreciated Soviet and Chinese support during the Korean War , but he had expected more , particularly from the Soviets , and he was dissatisfied that the war had ended in a stalemate .                                                                                                                                                              In 1961 , Pyongyang signed `` treaties of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance '' with both Moscow and Beijing , but events led Kim to question the credibility of these alliances .                                                                                                                                                                         First , Kim had to question the credibility of Moscow 's alliance commitment after Khrushchev backed down during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 .                                                                                  Only two months later , the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee adopted policies to strengthen the military and to implement import - substitution programs to reduce dependency on arms imports .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Second , there are reports that Kim Il Sung asked China to share its nuclear weapons technology following China 's first nuclear test in October 1964 , but Chairman Mao refused .                                                                                                                                                                                                    Shortly thereafter , North Korean relations with China began to deteriorate and they worsened during China 's Cultural Revolution .                                                            In the late 1960s , North Korea continued to expand its educational and research institutions to support a nuclear program for both civilian and military applications .                                                                                                                                                                                 By the early 1970s , North Korean engineers were using indigenous technology to expand the IRT- 2000 research reactor and Pyongyang began to acquire plutonium reprocessing technology from the Soviet Union .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In July 1977 , North Korea signed a trilateral safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the USSR that brought the IRT- 2000 research reactor and a critical assembly in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun under IAEA safeguards .                                                                                                                                                                           The Soviets were included in the agreement since they supplied the reactor fuel .                                                                   The early 1980s was a period of significant indigenous expansion , which included uranium milling facilities , a fuel rod fabrication complex , and a 5MW ( e ) nuclear reactor , as well as research and development institutions .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The early 1980s also marks the beginning of high explosives test that are required for the triggering mechanism in a nuclear bomb .                                                                                                                               By the mid - 1980s , Pyongyang began construction on a 50MW ( e ) nuclear power reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun , while expanding its uranium processing facilities .                                                                                                                                                                                                Some of technology and equipment acquired during this period had dual - use applications for a uranium enrichment program that was not revealed until the late 1990s .                                                                                                                                                                                                    North Korea 's energy concerns make nuclear energy a legitimate rationale for nuclear power , and Pyongyang explored the acquisition of light water reactor technology in the early to mid - 1980s .                                                                                                                                                                                                     This period coincided with the expansion of North Korea 's indigenously designed reactor program , which was based on gas - graphite moderated reactors similar in design to the Calder Hall reactors first built in the United Kingdom in the 1950s .                                                                                                                                                                                      In the early 1980s , Pyongyang was also exploring the acquisition of light water power reactors , and agreed to sign the NPT in December 1985 in exchange for Soviet assistance in the construction of four light water reactors .                                                                                                                                                                                                                After signing the NPT , countries have 18 months to complete a safeguards agreement with the IAEA .                                                                                           In North Korea 's case , it was later discovered that the agency provided the wrong documents for the safeguards agreement and the IAEA subsequently gave North Korea an additional 18 months to complete the agreement .                                                                                                                                                                                              Nevertheless , North Korea failed to meet the extended deadline , as Pyongyang demanded that the United States withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea , and that Washington and Seoul terminate the joint military exercise `` Team Spirit .

North and South Korea then signed the `` Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , '' whereby both sides promised `` not test , manufacture , produce , receive , possess , store , deploy or use nuclear weapons .

''                                                                                                                                                              The agreement also provided for a bilateral inspections regime , but the two sides failed to agree on its implementation .                                                                                                          North Korea finally signed an IAEA safeguards agreement on 30 January 1992 , and the Supreme People's Assembly ratified the agreement on 9 April .                                                                                                                         Under the terms of the agreement , North Korea provided an `` initial declaration '' of its nuclear facilities and materials , provided access for IAEA inspectors to verify the completeness and correctness of the initial declaration .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Six rounds of inspections began in May 1992 and concluded in February 1993 .                                                                          Pyongyang 's initial declaration included a small plutonium sample ( less than 100 grams ) , which North Korean officials said was reprocessed from damaged spent fuel rods that were removed from the 5MW ( e ) reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      However , IAEA analysis indicated that Korean technicians reprocessed plutonium on three occasions -- 1989, 1990 , and 1991 .                                                                                                               When the agency requested access to two suspect nuclear waste sites , North Korea declared them to be `` military sites '' and `` off - limits . ''                                                                                                                                                          1994 Crisis and the Agreed Framework                 After the IAEA was denied access to North Korea 's suspect waste sites in early 1993 , the Agency moved to ask the UN Security Council for special ad hoc inspections , but on 12 March 1993 , North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Under the terms of the treaty , withdrawal is not effective until 90 days after giving notice .                                                                                                    However , following intense bilateral negotiations with the United States , North Korea announced it was `` suspending its withdrawal from the NPT '' one day before the withdrawal was to become effective .                                                                                                                                                                                                      Pyongyang agreed to `` suspend '' its withdrawal while talks continued with Washington , but claimed to have a special status in regard to its nuclear safeguards commitments .                                                                                                                                                                       Under this `` special status , '' North Korea agreed to allow the `` continuity of safeguards '' on its present activities , but refused to allow inspections that could verify past nuclear activities .                                                                                                                                                                                       As talks with the United States over North Korea 's return to the NPT dragged on , North Korea continued to operate its 5MW ( e ) reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun .                                                                                                                                                                    By the spring of 1994 , the reactor core was burned up , and the spent fuel rods had to be discharged .                                                                                            On 14 May 1994 , Korean technicians began removing the spent fuel rods without the supervision of IAEA inspectors .                                                                                                             This action worsened the emerging crisis because the random placement of the spent fuel rods in a temporary storage pond compromised the IAEA 's capacity to reconstruct the operational history of the reactor , which could have been used in efforts to account for the discrepancies in Pyongyang 's reported plutonium reprocessing .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Clinton administration announced that it would ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions , but Pyongyang then declared that it would consider economic sanctions `` an act of war . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                         The crisis was defused in June 1994 when former President Jimmy Carter traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Il Sung .                                                                                  Carter announced from Pyongyang that Kim had accepted the broad outline of a deal that was later finalized as the `` Agreed Framework '' in October 1994 .                                                                                                       Under the agreement , North Korea agreed to freeze its gas - graphite moderated reactors and related facilities , and allow the IAEA to monitor that freeze .                                                                                                                                                                                           Pyongyang was also required to `` consistently take steps to implement the North - South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , '' and remain a party to the NPT .                                                                                                                                      In exchange , the United States agreed to lead an international consortium to construct two light water power reactors , and provide 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil per year until the first reactor came online with a target date of 2003 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Furthermore , the United States was to provide `` formal assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the US . ''                                                                                                                            Collapse of the Agreed Framework              While the Agreed Framework froze North Korea 's plutonium program for almost a decade , neither party was completely satisfied with either the compromise reached or its implementation .                                                                                                                                                    The United States was dissatisfied with the postponement of safeguards inspections to verify Pyongyang 's past activities , and North Korea was dissatisfied with the delayed construction of the light water power reactors .                                                                                                                                                                                                  In fact , Pyongyang had demanded compensation from Washington , but the US position has been that 2003 was only a `` target date '' and not a strict contractual commitment .                                                                                   After coming to office in 2001 , the new Bush administration initiated a North Korea policy review that was completed in early June .                                                                                   The policy review concluded that the United States should seek `` improved implementation of the Agreed Framework , verifiable constraints on North Korea 's missile program , a ban on missile exports , and a less threatening North Korean conventional military posture . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                           From Washington 's perspective , `` improved implementation of the Agreed Framework '' meant an acceleration of safeguards inspections , even though the agreement did not require Pyongyang to submit to full safeguards inspections to verify its past activities until a significant portion of the reactor construction was completed but before the delivery of critical reactor components .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In October 2002 , bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea finally resumed when US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs James Kelly visited Pyongyang .                                                                                                                             During the visit , Kelly informed First Vice Foreign Minister Kang So ( k Chu and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan that Washington was aware of a secret North Korean program to produce highly - enriched uranium ( HEU ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The US State Department claims that North Korean officials admitted to having such a program during a second day of meetings with Kelly , but North Korea now claims that it has only admitted to having a `` plan to produce nuclear weapons , '' which Pyongyang claims is part of its right to self - defense .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The United States responded in December 2002 by suspending heavy oil shipments , and North Korea then retaliated by lifting the freeze on its nuclear facilities , expelling IAEA inspectors monitoring that freeze , and announcing its withdrawal from the NPT on 10 January 2003 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Initially , North Korea claimed it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons , and that the lifting of the nuclear freeze was necessary to generate needed electricity .                                                                                                                                                                                                   On 10 February 2005 , the Foreign Ministry announced that North Korea had manufactured nuclear weapons , and in early April 2005 Pyongyang shut down its 5MW ( e ) nuclear reactor .                                                                                                                                                 If the spent fuel in the reactor core is reprocessed , North Korea will be able to obtain enough weapons - grade plutonium for 1 - 3 nuclear bombs .
