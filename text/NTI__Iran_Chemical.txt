   Overview        Being one of the few countries in the world that has experienced chemical warfare ( CW ) on the battlefield , Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997 .                                                                                                                              Iranian troops suffered tens of thousands of casualties from Iraqi chemical weapons during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq War .                                                                                                                    As a result Iran has promulgated a very public stance against the use of chemical weapons , making numerous vitriolic comments against Iraq 's use of such weapons in international forums .                                                                                                                                                        However , despite such rhetoric , several Western officials accuse Iran of developing similar offensive CW capabilities .                                                                                                                         US officials report that Iran can produce several hundred tons of chemical agent annually and that it may have already produced as much as 2,000 tons of agent , including mustard , cyanide , and possibly sarin nerve agent , at plants near Qazvin , Parchin , and Esfahan .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Officials also claim that Iran has produced bombs and artillery rounds filled with these agents , and that it can probably deploy chemical warheads on its long - range missiles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Iran is suspected of having developed such a capability with aid from individuals and companies in the West , as well as India and China .                                                                                                                                              Iran 's extensive CW program is allegedly masked using its sophisticated pharmaceutical and agro - industrial companies as plausible cover .                                                                                                                         It is further claimed that these companies serve as a front for importing important chemical precursors and related equipment , which are then diverted to the Iranian CW program .                                                                                                                                                                                      Although information on WMD programs for many countries is often limited , when it comes to assessing Iran 's alleged CW program , one must sift through a mountain of information , much of which is long on allegation and short on specific , corroborated evidence .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This difficulty is compounded by the fact that much of the information can be directly traced back to just a handful of sources , none of which can be independently verified .                                                                                                                               Most of the sources have a pre - existing bias against Iran , rendering a bulk of their information subject to speculation .                                                                                                       The following profile attempts to piece together an objective overview of allegations surrounding Iran and its CW capabilities by mining through reports in open source literature from a variety of sources .                                                                                                                                                                                     History        Iran 's entanglement with CW stems from the legacy of the Iran - Iraq War .                                                                           From approximately 1983 - 1988 during the war with Iraq , Iran suffered extensive CW attacks , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .                                                                                                                                                   By the end of the War , Iran appeared to have suffered as many as 50,000 chemical warfare casualties , of whom perhaps 5,000 died .                                                                                                                          The weak international response , particularly by the United Nations , to Iraqi use of chemical weapons against Iranian forces left Iran bitter about what it perceived to be a double standard in enforcing international agreements .                                                                                                                                                                                                  Many Iranian officials concluded that their country had to develop the ability to retaliate in kind in order to deter chemical weapons use against it .                                                                                                                                                                                      In a public interview , the Iranian representative to the United Nations , Rajai'e Korassani , stated that `` ... if the Iraqi regime does not take any steps in putting an end to the crimes of the Iraqi regime , we will retaliate in kind , and in that case , we will certainly announce it . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             However , several Iranian officials has never hidden his abhorrence of CW use in battlefield .                                                                                                    There are some reports that between 1984 and 1988 Iran employed chemical agents on a limited scale during the war with Iraq ; however , an intensive review of the open literature ( including UN reports from that era ) have failed to verify such claims .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This is despite near - constant Iranian rhetoric during the 1980s , invoking the threat of CW in retaliation if the world community failed to take any action against Iraq .                                                                                                                      While several Iranian leaders felt that developing a CW program would counteract the Iraqi threat and prove to be a strong deterrent , others within the clerical Islamic regime publicly condemned any use of chemicals on moral grounds , calling them un - Islamic .                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Disagreement over a course of policy action led to several contradictory published reports whether or not Iran decided to pursue a CW program .                                                                                                                                       Although the status of its offensive capability is somewhat ambiguous , one can definitely conclude that Iran has a defensive program that can be re - engineered into offensive production , if Iranian national security is threatened .                                                                                                                                                                               Agents and Delivery            Though there is no concrete evidence that Iran is currently developing CW , there have been several instances where CW precursors were purchased from foreign sources in the past .                                                                                                                                                                                                         Throughout the 1980s , the United States accused Germany of selling dual - use materials and technology to Iran .                                                                                                                                   In 1989 US authorities found Alcolac International Inc. , a pharmaceutical firm based out of Baltimore , Maryland , guilty of illegally shipping almost 120 tons of thiodyglycol ( a mustard gas precursor ) to Iran .                                                                                                                                                                                        The same year , US Department of Commerce put export controls on 23 specific chemicals that could aid CW proliferation .                                                                                                                 Also in 1989 , the State Trading Corporation of India admitted that it had sold Iran over 60 tons of thionyl chloride ( a nerve agent precursor ) and that its supplier was planning to ship an additional 257 tons of the chemical to Iran .                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In 1997 , under a reported multi - million dollar deal , India agreed to construct a `` sophisticated chemical plant at Qazvim , on the outskirts of Tehran . ''                                                                                                                                                    India also agreed to sell Iran phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical used in the production of pesticides as well as the nerve agent VX .                                                                                                                                                                          The deal eventually fell apart and a similar deal was eventually concluded with China in 1998 .                                                                                                   China reportedly agreed to sell Iran 500 tons of phosphorus pentasulfide .                                                                                            China has also been involved in several other sales to Iran , involving CW technology ; as a result , several Chinese companies and individuals have faced American sanctions .                                                                                                                                                                                One example was the 1997 sale by China to Iran of 40,000 barrels of calcium - hypochlorite , a chemical and biological decontaminating agent .                                                                                                               Other defensive material purchased by Iran includes respirators from Spain , protective gear from South Korea , and atropine autoinjectors from the Netherlands .                                                                                                                                        In 1995 , Asian- Ways, Ltd. World Co (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Mainway International Ltd. were sanctioned by the US State Department for supplying Iran with `` nerve gas technology . ''                                                                                                        According to US press accounts citing a top secret CIA report dated 2 October 1996 , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of carbon disulfide , a nerve and riot control gas precursor .                                                                                                                                                                         In 1997 , two more Chinese companies and were sanctioned by the US State Department for selling Iran CW related precursors and equipment .                                                                                                                                                                 The companies involved were Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import / Export Corporation .                                                                        They were accused of exporting thionyl chloride , dimethylamine , and ethylene chlorohydrin .                                                            Some of the CW agents Iran has allegedly developed include CS gas ( a riot control agent ) , mustard gas , hydrogen cyanide , and phosgene .                                                                                                                                                   Some sources , citing US intelligence officials , also claim that Iran has developed sarin , tabun , and V - series nerve agents .                                                                                                                                                 There are several delivery routes Iran could take for its chemical agents .                                                                         Iran is said to have developed 155 mm artillery shells , mortar rounds , aerial bombs for chemical fill , and possibly chemical warheads for Scuds .                                                                                    There have also been rumors of using mines to deliver CW agents ( 120 mm ) .                                                                                                                 Iran 's well - known Shahab missile is also believed to be capable of carrying chemical warheads , although it is uncertain warheads have been developed or tested .                                                                                                                                                                                          In 2002 , Iran tested a new version of its Muajar-4 ( Mohajer ) unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) , which some experts claim could be used for potential CBW delivery .                                                                                                                                                                                                           Status        Despite its acquisition of precursors from abroad , Iran is allegedly working to develop an indigenous CW production capability .                                                                                                                                     The CIA believes that `` Teheran is rapidly approaching self-sufficiency and could become a supplier of CW - related materials to other nations . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                  As of 1996 , the Department of Defense claimed that Iran had stockpiled almost 2000 tons of toxic chemical agents and was continuously working on expanding its CW program .                                                                                                                                                                                  Iran has several advanced research institutions employing various chemicals for a variety of reasons , including pesticide production , pharmaceutical research , and other medical studies .                                                                                                                                                                                    Iran has also conducted several military exercises to date that have included defensive chemical and biological weapons maneuvers .                                                                                                                                             Iran continues to deny any allegations that it is actively pursuing an offensive CW program .                                                                                                                                 In 1996 , it held the first regional seminar on the national implementation of the CWC in Tehran so that government authorities could familiarize themselves with their duties and obligations under the treaty .                                                                                                                                                                    It also held a mock `` trial inspection '' at the Shahid Razkani chemical factory to allow inspectors to see how such a procedure was conducted .                                                                                                                                   Iran submitted a declaration on its chemical facilities and its past CW stockpile , it has destroyed chemical weapons production equipment in the presence of OPCW inspectors , and it has undergone a number of OPCW inspections of its chemical industrial facilities .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Iran continues to play an active role at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , is recognized as a member in good standing , and currently serves on its executive council .                                                                                                               Although US and Israeli intelligence agencies continue to insist Iran maintains a stockpile of chemical weapons , no challenge inspections of Iranian facilities have been requested , and none of the allegations made regarding the stockpiling of CW can be verified in the unclassified domain .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         However , Iran continues to retain a strong incentive for developing a defensive CW program .                                                                                                Major Suppliers / Major Exporters The following summary lists key Iranian imports within the realm of its CW program .                                                                                     Several chemicals are dual - use in nature and imported under the umbrella of pesticide , petrochemical , and various pharmaceutical ventures .                                                                                                     These sales do not necessarily indicate the presence of an offensive CW capability but are worth noting due to their potential diversion to an illicit Iranian CW program .                                                                                                                                                                             Britain         Early 1990s , According to the British Observer , the British government exported chemicals to Iran that can be used to manufacture weapons .                                                                                                                                            China         Chinese companies have been key suppliers for Iran 's chemical weapons program .                                                                                                          The Chinese corporation SinoChem reportedly delivered 500 tons of phosphorous pentasulfide in 1996 ( primary precursor of VX , controlled by the Australia Group ; China and Iran are not party to this organization ) .                                                                                                                                                                                  According to US press reports citing a top secret CIA report , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of chemicals used to produce nerve agents and riot control gas .                                                                                                                                                                                                           China is a key supplier of CW equipment and technologies to Iran according to US Department of Defense .                                                                                                                        In an unclassified report to Congress , the DCI said that `` Chinese firms had supplied CW - related production equipment and technology to Iran , '' prior to July 1999 , and that evidence during the second half of 1999 `` suggests Iran continues to seek such assistance from Chinese entities , but it is unclear to what extent these efforts have succeeded .

In June 1997 , the DCI reported that China , during July - December 1996 , provided `` considerable CW - related assistance '' to Iran , including production equipment and technology .                                                                                                                                                                                According to an intelligence report , cited by the Washington Times on 30 October 1997 , China completed construction in June 1997 of a dual - use plant in Iran for making glass - lined equipment used in producing chemical weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Chinese firm was Nanjing Chemical and Industrial Group .                                                        A classified US intelligence report identified a Chinese individual , Q.C. Chen , as `` a major supplier of glass - lined equipment and chemicals to Iran 's chemical weapons program .

In 1995 , orders paid for by Razak Laboratories in Teheran and Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries in Tabriz , and brokered by Iran 's International Movalled Industries Corporation ( Imaco ) with the North Chemical Industries Corp. ( Nocinco ) , were not delivered .                                                                                                                                                      They consisted of 49 metric tons of alkyl dimethylamine , used in making detergent , and 17 metric tons of sodium sulfide , a chemical that could be used in making mustard gas .                                                                                                                                                                          In January - February 1997 , China supplied Iran with 40,000 barrels of calcium hypochlorite , a chemical - biological - radiological decontamination agent .                                                                                                         In 1997 , Rex International Development Company Ltd. , a company affiliated with the Chinese company Norinco , supplied Iran with high - grade seamless steel pipes , suitable for handling corrosive materials , and associated with chemical weapons production .                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In 1997 , two Chinese companies , Nanjing Industries Group and Technology Import / Export Corporation , supplied Iran with thionyl chloride , dimethylamine ( tabun nerve gas precursor ) , ethyl chlorohydrin ( possible mustard precursor ) , and glass - lined mixing vessels .                                                                                                                                                                                                               On 8 March 1996 , the Washington Post reported , `` US intelligence officials have concluded that companies in China are providing Iran with several virtually complete factories suited for making deadly poison gases , '' and that Iranian `` military - related organizations '' are buying from China glass - lined vessels for mixing precursors , special air - filtration equipment , and the technology to manufacture these items and others indigenously .

The report mentions the sale of 58,000 gas masks by Shalon Chemical Industries after the Iran - Iraq War as well as the supply of gas detectors by Elbit for the identification of chemical warfare agents .

Libya used these agents against Chadian troops later that year .                                                This allegation was brought forth mostly by US government sources and can not be verified .                                                                            Poland         In the mid - 1980s , Mana International Investments , a company registered in Poland and controlled by Nachum Manbar , an Israeli businessman , supplied Iran with NBC protective suits .

Spain         In 1988 , Spain supplied Iran with 200,000 respirators .                                                 Syria         In 1985 , Syria reportedly agreed to supply Iran with chemical weapons , but apparently later backed away from the offer .                                                                                              In 1994 , reports surfaced that Syria is cooperating with Iran in the development of ballistic missiles designed to carry chemical warheads .                                                                                                                                       Ukraine         On 18 December 1997 , the Islamic Republic News Agency ( IRNA ) reported that the Eastern railroad network , run by the Bonyad-e Mostazafan va Janbazan , has purchased 100 tank cars from Ukraine , specifically designed to transport highly toxic chemicals .                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Several countries          According to Michael Eisenstadt , Iran initially obtained chemical agent precursors from the United States , Germany , and Japan .                                                                                                   When stricter export controls were imposed by these countries in the mid to late 1980s , Iran had to find alternative sources , such as India .                                                                                                              In recent years , China has been the principal source of CW precursors , as well as production technology .                                                                                                                   Iran is currently working on becoming self sufficient in the production of these materials .                                                                          Capabilities        Iran has a sophisticated base for the development of a chemical weapons program dating back to the Iran - Iraq War ( 1980 - 1988 ) -- a conflict that gave Iran strong incentives for developing a robust chemical defense capability .                                                                                                                                                                                                               There are several unclassified allegations and reports that suggest Iran has developed an offensive CW program as well .                                                                                                                                                Most of these claims can not be verified in open sources .                                                                            However , reports of transactions of various dual - use material is publicly known .                                                                                                           Imports such as thiodyglycol and thionyl chloride can be applied towards legitimate purposes such as dyes , textiles , and pesticides or can be diverted towards an illicit CW program .                                                                                                                                                Iran also imported several tons of phosphorus pentasulfide , which is on the Australia Group 's watch list for controlled chemical precursors , but not on the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) Schedule lists .                                                                                                                       The compound has several legitimate uses in the agricultural industry , specifically relating to pesticides , but is also a starting point for nerve agents such as VX .                                                                                                            Based on such information , some idea of Iran 's CW status can be ascertained .
