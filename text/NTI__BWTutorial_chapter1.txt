   Introduction to BW Terrorism                      The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Nevertheless , numerous misconceptions persist about the nature of CBW terrorism -- in particular , how easy it would be for terrorists to produce and employ such weapons .                                                                                                                                                                        This tutorial addresses several aspects of biological warfare ( BW ) terrorism , with the goal of providing a greater understanding of the threat and the available policy responses .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               How vulnerable is the United States to BW terrorism , and what types of attacks should it be most concerned about ?                                                                                                                                                   Further , what can be done to prevent or reduce the likelihood of incidents of BW terrorism ?                                                                                                                           The tutorial is organized into six chapters .                             This introductory chapter defines CBW terrorism , explores what types of terrorist groups would be most likely to carry out such attacks , and summarizes U.S. government actions to combat CBW terrorism before and after September 11 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The next five chapters focus on the technical aspects of biological terrorism , including the biological agents of greatest concern ; the technical hurdles associated with their acquisition , production , and delivery ; historical cases of bioterrorism ; and approaches to the prevention and mitigation of bioterrorist incidents .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Defining Terrorism                  Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''                                                                                                                                                  For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .                                                                                                                                     The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''                                                                                                                                                                                    Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .                                                                               For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .                                                                                                            During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .                                                                                                                      The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .                                                                                 For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons                                                In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .                                                                                                                                                                                                   They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .                                                                                                   Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .                                                                                                                                                                      Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .                                                                                                                  Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .                                                                                                                                            They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .                                                                                                                                                  Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .                                                                                  Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?                                                              There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:                                                                                                                                                                                                        If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .                                                                                                                                                CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .                                                                                                                                                                                    Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .                                                                                                                                         The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .                                                                                                                                   Characteristics of CBW Terrorists                                    Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .                                                                                                                                                                                  Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .                                                                                 Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .                                                                                                                                                                               Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .                                                                                                                                    Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .                                                                                                                                                                                                        Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?                                                                           Even before the events of September 11 and the anthrax letter attacks of fall 2001 , analysts began to observe some troubling developments along all three dimensions of the CBW terrorism threat .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to CBW terrorism .                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .                                                                                                                                                                                                         Further details about the motivation and organizational structure of the terrorist groups most likely to carry out CBW attacks are provided in the next two pages. ( The specific capabilities required to acquire and deliver biological agents are discussed in subsequent chapters . )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Motivation                 In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .                                                                                                            Such groups engage in violent attacks against civilian targets with the aim of influencing public opinion and applying pressure on government officials .                                                                                                                                                                   Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated terrorists to inflict too many casualties , for two reasons:                                                                      These groups have an outside constituency that would be alienated by indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks , potentially triggering a political backlash .                                                             Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .                                                                                                                                                            Over the past few decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .                                                                                                                           In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies ( such as neo - Nazism ) , apocalyptic prophecy ( predicting the end of the world ) , or religious fundamentalism .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Religious Terrorism                     Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       According to terrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman , in 1968 , none of the 11 major terrorist organizations then active was religiously motivated .                                                                                                                                 By 1995 , however , 26 out of 56 known , active international terrorist groups could be classified as religious in character and / or motivation .                                                                                                                          Such groups either promote extreme forms of the world 's major religions or entirely `` new '' belief systems , usually in the form of cults .                                                                                                                            Examples include the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan and The Covenant , the Sword , and the Arm of the Lord ( CSA ) in the United States .                                                                                      Religiously motivated terrorist groups are more likely than political terrorists to resort to non - conventional weapons for the following reasons:                                                                                                       They may desire not just to make a symbolic point but to physically and completely destroy their enemies .                                                                                      They may view extreme violence as divinely sanctioned and the fulfillment of God 's commandments .                                                               They are largely unaffected by public opinion because they act on behalf of their deity and their co - religionists .                                                                 They may believe in apocalyptic prophecy and actively seek to bring about Armageddon , or the end of the world .                                                                                                                Single - Issue Terrorism                        Another new type of terrorist organization focuses on a single , hotly disputed issue such as abortion , animal rights , environmental protection , or genetic engineering .                                                                                                                                                                Members of these groups feel passionately about their chosen issue and are prepared to strike out violently against those who disagree with them .                                                                                                               The Army of God , for example , is an extremist anti - abortion group that has assassinated doctors who perform abortions and has sent hundreds of anthrax hoax letters to family - planning clinics around the United States .                                                                                                                                                                                                 Right Wing Terrorism                       The 1990s saw the rise of right - wing terrorism , including neo - Nazis and neo - Fascists in Europe and white supremacists and anti - government ( `` Patriot '' ) organizations in the United States .                                                                                                                                        The Patriot movement subscribes to a conspiratorial world-view in which the federal government is in league with Jewish bankers to deprive ordinary Americans of their land and liberty .                                                                                                 Patriot groups in rural areas often form armed militias that stockpile weapons and conduct training exercises in preparation for an anticipated violent showdown with the federal government or United Nations forces .                                                                                                                                                                                                                   These confrontations are not purely in the realm of fantasy , however .                                       Several highly publicized clashes between federal authorities and local armed groups have occurred over the past decade , including the confrontation between Randy Weaver and federal marshals at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , on August 21 - 22, 1992 , during which Weaver 's son and wife were killed ; and the disastrous siege by federal agents of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas , in April 1993 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In the United States , right - wing extremism is often linked to the Christian Identity church , a twisted form of Christianity that is bitterly racist and anti - Semitic .                                                                                                Members of the church believe that whites are the real children of Israel , Jews are the evil offspring of Satan or Cain , and blacks and other racial minorities are sub - human .                                                                                                                                       Some Christian Identity groups believe in apocalyptic prophecy , including the `` purifying '' role of biblical plagues to vanquish sinners and help bring about Armageddon and the Second Coming .                                                                                                          Some subscribers to Patriot and Christian Identity ideology are not formal members of right - wing groups .                                                                 Instead , they constitute what terrorism analyst Jerrold Post has called a `` community of belief , '' linked through email and Internet websites rather than direct interpersonal contact .                                                                                                                                 Timothy McVeigh , who perpetrated the April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City , was not a member of a Patriot organization but identified strongly with the anti - government community of belief .                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Al Qa'ida Network               Al Qa'ida ( Arabic for `` The Base `` ) is a loosely connected global network of Islamic terrorist groups that seek to expel U.S. troops from the Middle East , inflict revenge for what they perceive as America 's attacks on Muslims and its one - sided support of Israel , and eliminate Western cultural influences they consider contrary to Islam .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Many Al Qa'ida terrorists are prepared to sacrifice their own lives to carry out attacks , making them essentially impossible to deter .                                                                                                                  On September 11, 2001 , nineteen Al Qa'ida terrorists hijacked four commercial aircraft and flew three of them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ; the fourth crashed into a field in Shanksville , Pennsylvania .                                                                                                                                                   This single incident caused more than 3,000 deaths .                                                          Shaped by a fanatical worldview , the terrorists sought to kill as many Americans as possible while striking at symbolic targets of U.S. economic and military power .                                                                                                                                                     The September 11 attacks were also characterized by innovative tactics , impressive execution , and a sharp escalation in the level of violence .                                                                                        A few pieces of evidence suggest that Al Qa'ida is interested in acquiring chemical and biological weapons .                                                                                                                             The network 's mastermind , Osama bin Laden , has stated openly that it is his `` religious duty '' to acquire weapons of mass destruction .                                                                                                                        In March 2002 , U.S. troops in Afghanistan found an abandoned laboratory under construction near Kandahar where Al Qa'ida members apparently planned to develop biological agents .                                                                                                                                  In August 2002 , the Cable News Network ( CNN ) broadcast an Al Qa'ida training video showing experiments on dogs with cyanide gas .                                                                                On March 1, 2003 , documents and computer hard drives were seized during the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , a key operational planner for Al Qa'ida .                                                                                                  These materials revealed that the organization had recruited a Pakistani microbiologist , acquired materials to manufacture botulinum toxin , and developed a workable plan for anthrax production .                                                                                                                       No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .
