   Nuclear Overview        Syria has a small nuclear program that can be described , at best , as `` elemental '' to a nuclear fuel cycle program .                                                                                                                           Most of the program has revolved around research and the production of isotopes for use in medical and agricultural applications .                                                                                                                        Although Syria does not appear to have ever pursued nuclear weapons , there have been rumors that it considered doing so in the early 1980s .                                                                                                                                                                        These rumors are mainly based on statements made by high - level Syrian officials and would-be arms suppliers .                                                                                                      However , no nuclear weapons program has ever materialized or been initiated .                                                                           It appears that the Syrian nuclear program continues to be focused solely on civilian nuclear research , based on international cooperation , and set to support a continued domestic aspiration for a nuclear power program .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Assistance to Syria has come from various countries including Belgium , China , Germany , and the former Soviet Union .                                                                                                      Additionally , over the years , Syria has solicited proposals from other countries including Argentina , India , and Italy .                                                                                             The International Atomic Energy Association ( IAEA ) has assisted Syria on numerous projects including uranium exploration , uranium extraction from phosphoric acid , isotope production , construction of a cyclotron facility , development of nuclear research laboratories , and preparation for a nuclear power program .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             History        Syria signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1969 .                                                                           It took this step to obtain the political and technical benefits that come from signing the treaty .                                                                                In the aftermath of its losses in the Six Day War , Syria felt that it needed broader support from the international community to guard against Israeli acts of aggression .                                                                                                                                                              Additionally , the government wanted to take advantage of technical assistance from the IAEA and its member states that is only available after a state signs the NPT .                                                                                                                                                               In 1979 , Syria established its Atomic Energy Commission ( AECS ) largely to manage IAEA assistance programs and to plan for the eventual development of a nuclear power program .                                                                                                                                                                       In 1983 , the IAEA assisted Syria in establishing an analytical laboratory that was equipped with systems for atomic spectrometry and various other experiments .                                                                                                                                       Five Syrian scientists were trained in Hungary , the United States , Yugoslavia , and Austria as a part of the project .                                                                                                                        Also in 1983 , Syrian and Soviet scientists carried out a joint study on the construction of a nuclear power reactor in Syria .                                                                                                                                                    This study was part of an IAEA cooperative assistance project to help Syria understand the requirements for developing and maintaining a nuclear program .                                                                                                                                                                                                     Although Syria has probably never attempted to indigenously build nuclear weapons , there have been rumors that it might be interested in obtaining such weapons to deter an Israeli nuclear weapons threat .                                                                                                                                                                                   In fact , in 1986 , when questioned on his opinion of the Israeli nuclear arsenal , Syrian Chief of Staff General Hihmet Al-Siabi suggested that Syria would strive to achieve strategic equality with Israel including nuclear parity .                                                                                                                                                             In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Syria began exploring its potential for indigenous nuclear resources .                                                                                                                  Upon completion of several uranium exploration projects , Syria began experiments to extract uranium from its vast phosphoric rock reserves .                                                                                                                                                        In 1986 , the IAEA and AECS constructed a micro - plant at the General Phosphate Company Plant in Homs to study the process of uranium extraction from phosphoric acid .                                                                                                                                           The plant would be the forerunner to a commercial plant if Syria obtained a nuclear power reactor and needed fresh fuel regularly .                                                                                                                                                  In 1996 , Syria began developing a plant to recover uranium from tri -superphosphates using a similar technology .                                                                                                                    That facility came online in 2001 .                             In 1991 , China started constructing Syria 's first research reactor , a 30 KW miniature neutron source reactor ( MNSR ) to be located at the Der Al-Hadjar Nuclear Research Center near Damascus .                                                                                                                                                                                                                 China provided Syria with approximately 980 grams of 89% enriched U235 to operate the reactor .                                                                                                                That facility went critical in 1996 and become fully operational in 1998 .                                                                                                                The MNSR gives Syria the capability to produce neutrons for nuclear analysis , isotopes for industrial applications , and radioisotopes for training purposes , but is unsuitable for weapons production .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In 1997 , the IAEA approved a technical assistance project to provide Syria with a cyclotron facility .                                                                                                                      It was to be built at the Nuclear Medicine Centre in Damascus .                                                                                      The Cyclon-30 cyclotron , provided by Belgium 's Ion Beam Applications , is the same model as the cyclotron in Iran , where it is suspected of being used to enrich uranium .                                                                                                                                                                                 The facility 's status is unknown .                                           In more recent years , Syria has continued to develop its nuclear research facilities and other facilities to help manage its nuclear material .                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The government has also entered into new cooperation agreements with several countries , most notably Russia .                                                                                                             In 1998 , the intergovernmental Russia - Syrian Commission on Trade and Scientific and Technical Cooperation signed of a memorandum of cooperation between Russia 's Ministry of Atomic Energy and the AECS .                                                                                                                                      Part of this accord was an agreement to construct a nuclear research center that would include a 25MW research reactor .                                                                                                                                                                          Current Status        Syria 's nuclear program remains in the fundamental stages of development , with virtually no fuel cycle facilities in operation .                                                                                                                                             However , there are a number of operating research facilities in Syria , including the Der Al-Hadjar Nuclear Research Center near Damascus , a nuclear analysis laboratory , and the Scientific Research Institute ( SRI ) in Damascus .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The SRI has allegedly taken in Iraqi scientists prior to the recent Gulf War .                                                                                                   In December 2002 , an Italian newspaper cited an Iraqi officer who asserted that Syria had allowed Iraq to store its weapons of mass destruction in Syria research centers .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       These allegations were never confirmed .                                          In 2003 , Russian and Syrian officials continued their negotiations for the construction of a nuclear facility that would include a nuclear power plant and a seawater atomic desalination plant .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Open sources reported that the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy confirmed that discussions over supplying Syria with a power plant and a desalination plant were taking place .                                                                                                                                                                                                                 However , the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman refuted the Minatom statement and denied that any discussion had taken place .                                                                                                                       Consequently , Syria 's quest for obtaining a nuclear power plant remains an unanswered question .                                                                                                                      In 2004 , Syria responded to U.S. and U.K. pressure to relinquish its WMD by declaring that it is prepared to do so when Israel does the same .                                                                                                                                                                                                      The United States imposed sanctions in May , citing Syria 's pursuit of WMD programs as one of the reasons for this step .                                                                                                                                             A Syria - EU trade accord hurdle was resolved in October with agreement on a WMD clause , subject to final approval by EU foreign ministers .                                                                                                                                                                                     IAEA chief ElBaradei has asserted that there is no reason to believe Syria was a client of A.Q. Khan 's nuclear proliferation network .                                                                                                                                                                     The head of the Iraq Survey Group Charles Duelfer has exhausted his search for WMD in Iraq .                                                                                                                       He stated that there is no evidence that WMD were transferred to Syria before the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
