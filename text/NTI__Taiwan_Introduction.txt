   Taiwan Overview :            Note : Taiwan is claimed by both the Government of the People's Republic of China and the authorities on Taiwan .                                                                           It is administered by the authorities on Taiwan .                                                   Taiwan does not possess nuclear weapons , but began a covert nuclear weapons program in 1964 that ended in 1988 as a result of U.S. pressure .                                                                                                                                                                                  Taiwan signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1968 and has implemented the International Atomic Energy Agency 's ( IAEA ) `` Program 93+2 '' safeguards .                                                                                                 Despite persistent suspicions of offensive and defensive chemical and biological weapons ( CBW ) programs , there is no conclusive evidence that Taiwan has developed or deployed chemical or biological weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                       Taiwan is currently developing the Tien Chi , a short-range ballistic missile system that can reach the coast of China .                                                                                                                                         Nuclear:         Taiwan 's first nuclear reactor was built at National Tsinghua University in 1956 , and its first nuclear power plant was opened in 1965 .                                                                                                                                   Taiwan now possesses six nuclear units housed in three nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 5,144 megawatts .                                                                                              Although plagued by domestic opposition and delays , a fourth nuclear power plant is scheduled to begin operation in 2006 .                                                                                                            Taiwan 's nuclear weapons program was established under the direction of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research ( INER ) and the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology following the People's Republic of China 's first nuclear test in October 1964 .                                                                                                                                                                                           The `` Hsin Chu `` program involved procurement and operation of a heavy water reactor , a heavy water production plant , a reprocessing research laboratory , and a plutonium separation plant .                                                                                                                                                                                     U.S. pressure caused Taiwan to end its nuclear weapons program in 1988 after International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspections discovered missing fuel rods and the former deputy director of INER defected to the United States with detailed information about Taiwan 's program .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Taiwan probably possesses the technological expertise necessary to develop nuclear weapons , but U.S. pressure and the possibility of a pre-emptive strike by China have prevented a resumption of the nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Biological:         Taiwan has been accused of making efforts to acquire a biological weapons ( BW ) capability .                                                                                                                      A report from the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service claimed that Taiwan has developed three dozen types of bacteria , apparently for weaponization purposes .                                                                                                                                                 This report , of questionable reliability , was vigorously denied by the Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) .                                                                                                     Taiwan signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1972 , but its role in this treaty is not officially recognized .                                                                                Taiwan has not been permitted to join the Australia Group .                                                           Chemical :           In 1989 , the U.S. Congress was informed that Taiwan could have acquired an offensive chemical weapons ( CW ) capability .                                                                                                                                   While acknowledging production of small quantities of CW agents for defense research purposes , Taiwanese authorities have consistently denied any offensive CW capabilities .                                                                                                                                                                                            Still , rumors persist that Taiwan has stockpiled sarin in two locations : Tsishan ( Kaohsiung ) and in Kuanhsi , Hsinchu County .                                                                                                                                      Chemical defense research and development is conducted at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology .                                                                                        Because of Taiwan 's non - state status , it can not join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) nor the Australia Group .                                                                                Missile:         Taiwan 's short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) program is based at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , which has developed a range of missiles including the Hsiung Feng series of anti-ship missiles , the Tien Chien series of air - to - air missiles , and the Tien Kung series of surface - to - air missiles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  These systems have provided Taiwanese scientists with experience and a technological base in areas such as composite materials and guidance and fire control systems , which are essential for development of longer range surface -to - surface missiles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Taiwan has two SRBM programs .                                                            The liquid - fueled , single - stage Ching Feng has a range of 130 km with a 270 kg payload .                                                          Initially deployed in the early 1980s , it is unclear how many Ching Feng missiles were built and whether they are still operational .                                                                                                     The Tien Chi , first test - fired in 1997 , is a solid - fueled , two - stage missile with a 300 km range that can reach China 's southeastern coast .                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Tien Chi incorporates global positioning system technology and has an estimated payload of 100 - 500 kg. One report claims that as many as 50 Tien Chi missiles have been deployed on Tungyin Island and at an unidentified second location .                                                                                                                                                                                     Development of the Tien Ma , a ballistic missile with a range of 950 km , was reportedly discontinued in the early 1980s due to U.S. pressure .
