   Chemical Overview          This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .                                                                                                            If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .                                                                                                                                             It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .                                                                                                     Reportedly , the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major classes , such as phosgene ( choking ) , hydrogen cyanide ( blood ) , mustard ( blister ) and sarin ( nerve agent ) .                                                                                                                                                                However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      During the three decades after the establishment of the DPRK ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW program had uneven success in obtaining and weaponizing CW agents .                                                                                                                                                   However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     According to defector accounts , the DPRK 's long - range missiles such as the Nodong , and other ballistic rockets and artillery pieces with calibres larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW agents .                                                                                                                                                                        Despite North Korea 's moribund economy and some hints of softening rhetoric from its leadership , the quantity and quality of new artillery placed near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) have actually increased in the last several years .                                                                                                                                                                                             Many of these artillery platforms , including multiple launch rocket systems ( MLRS ) of up to 320 mm , are forwardly deployed near the DMZ .                                                                                                                      This deployment represents a significant threat to heavily populated Seoul , as well as to the entire peninsula in the event of a southward invasion by the Korean People's Army ( KPA ) .                                                                                                                                                        Background       As early as 1947 , the KPA manual addressed at least the theory of CW operational doctrine .                                                                         It noted the utility of forcing the enemy to `` suit up '' in preparation for real or imagined use of chemical agents , for doing so would degrade the fighting ability of enemy forces .                                                                                                                                                           By 1954 , the KPA established nuclear , biological , and chemical ( NBC ) defense units , probably along the lines of the Soviet model .                                                                                                                     According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .                                                                                                                                                    Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau ( NCDB ) was also established during this time .                                                                                                                                                                                                In 1966 , for reasons that are unclear , the DPRK later turned to the Soviets for assistance in CW , mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents .                                                                                                                                                                                 Following this period of Soviet - led assistance , North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare .                                                                                                                 Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .                                                                                                                                                                                                   Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .                                                                                                                                                                                        In January 1987 , the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .                                                                                                                                                                                     Recent estimates of North Korean chemical ordnance by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) have since been raised to the thousands of tons , probably based on recent information provided by North Korean defectors , including former members of DPRK military and NBC defence organizations .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Suspected North Korean Chemical Weapons Arsenal                                        The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk , but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads .                                                                                                                                                    Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    CW agents are then moved to either a Sakchu - or Kanggye - based chemical weapons facility for weaponization , i.e. , the filling of weapons with agents for deployment .                                                                                                                                                                      It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention , and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo .                                                                                                                                                        CW Agents          Open - source assessments of North Korean chemical weapons stockpiles have changed significantly over the past decade .                                                                                                     Reports by defectors and other accounts in the open literature indicate that North Korea currently possesses blister ( e.g. , mustard ) , nerve ( e.g. , sarin ) , choking ( e.g. , phosgene ) , and blood agents ( e.g. , hydrogen cyanide ) .                                                                                                                                                                                                    A North Korean defector in 1997 told a U.S. Congressional committee that the DPRK possessed a blister agent called `` Lizut , '' or Lewisite , in its arsenal .                                                                                                                                                 VE and VG nerve agents are also mentioned in South Korean assessments of DPRK chemical weapons , although these reports do not appear to be based on hard data but rather on inference .                                                                                                                                                                  A 1999 report by the U.S. Congress stated the following with regard to how the North Korean military views chemical weaponry :                                                                                                                             Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .                                                                                                                          There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .                                                                                     The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .                                                                                 Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Delivery Systems                     Over half of North Korea 's 1.2 million - man army is deployed within 90 miles of the DMZ , as are thousands of artillery systems .                                                                                                                                                            Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     North Korea 's chemical defense force is estimated to be around 13,000 personnel , probably making it the third - largest CW service in the world , with chemical defense units incorporated at the regimental level .                                                                                                                                                                                            The Hamhung Chemical Engineering College is responsible for much of the training of the Korean People's Army in CW defense .                                                                                    Two main factories located in the cities of Kanggye and Sakchu are reportedly tasked with the final preparation , filling , and distribution of CW agents in artillery shells from 80 mm and larger , as well as 240 mm caliber artillery rockets .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Testing of agents is also reportedly performed at these two locations , possibly in very large underground facilities .                                                                                                                                                   In addition to thousands of artillery rounds , hundreds of forward deployed Scud-B , Frog-5 and Frog-7 missiles , plus about 30 Scud-C missiles could be armed with chemical warheads .                                                                                                                                                                                                All of them could easily strike much of South Korea .                                              A South Korean security analyst suggested that DPRK artillery pieces of calibers 170 mm and 240 mm `` could fire 10,000 rounds per minute to Seoul and its environs . ''                                                                                                                                                 Given all of North Korea 's artillery along on the DMZ , it has been estimated that the KPA could fire over 5 million artillery shells per hour .                                                                                                                Status       In 1994 , during heightened tensions over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , the DPRK threatened to turn Seoul into a `` sea of fire . ''                                                                                                                           One of the highest ranking North Korean government officials to defect to the South , Hwang Jang Yop , said in April 1997 that the DPRK military was able to do just that , using a combination of chemical and nuclear weapons delivered by missiles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .                                                                                                          To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .                                                                                                                                                     However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .                                                                                                                                                            During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .                                                                                                                          For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .                                                                                                                    Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .                                                                       But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .                                                                                                                                                    The relatively small amount ( 50kg ) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .                                                                                     But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .                                                                                                                 Nonetheless , the DPRK has also shown a single-minded emphasis on buttressing its military capabilities despite a poverty - stricken economy and populace .                                                                                                                 Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             North Korea and the Chemical Weapons Convention                              In the early 1990s -- according to reports from DPRK defectors -- the North Korean Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces debated over whether to join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .                                                                                                                                                                  Although the foreign ministry was apparently in favor of participating in the regime , the military was opposed , and Kim Chong Il apparently sided with the latter .                                                                                                                 Since 1997 , the South Korean government has insisted that the DPRK join the CWC , to no avail .                                                                                     North Korea has also rebuffed efforts on the part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , as well as the Japanese government , to persuade it to participate in the chemical disarmament regime .                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .                                                                                                                                                                              In the short term , however , a knowledgeable official at the OPCW noted that North Korea would not reap immediate benefits by joining the CWC regime .
