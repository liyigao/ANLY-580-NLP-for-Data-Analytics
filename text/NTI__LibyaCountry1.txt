   Introduction         Libya has shown interest in and taken steps to acquire weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and their delivery systems .                                                                                                                       Indeed , it is one of the few states to have employed chemical weapons in a conflict ( Chad , 1987 ) .                                                                                                               Libya 's motivation to acquire WMD , and ballistic missiles in particular , appears in part to be a response to Israel 's clandestine nuclear program and a desire to become a more active player in Middle_Eastern and African politics .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    On 19 December 2003 , Libyan leader Col. Muammar Qadhafi publicly confirmed his commitment to disclose and dismantle WMD programs in his country following a nine-month period of negotiations with US and UK authorities .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Nuclear         In its 19 December 2003 announcement that it was eliminating all materials , equipment and programs proscribed by the international community , Libya took the unusual step of first publicly revealing its nuclear weapons program , then renouncing it .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Libya then invited the IAEA to verify the elimination of nuclear weapon related activities in-country .                                                                                                                             According to International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei , who led a December 2003 inspection team to Libya , Libya 's nuclear weapons program is in the very initial stages , about three to seven years away from producing a nuclear weapon .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Libya admitted having secretly imported raw uranium and the necessary equipment to convert it for enrichment into weapons-grade material but added that the enrichment plan had been dismantled and that no highly enriched uranium had been produced over the past decade .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          IAEA inspectors did not found either , though they did find imported equipment and technology at a number of previously secret nuclear facilities in and around Tripoli .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It has been revealed that Abdul Qadeer Khan of Pakistan is responsible for providing Libya with its nuclear warhead plans , raw uranium and enrichment centrifuges through his black market network .                                                                                                                                                                       In his 19 December 2003 announcement , Qadhafi pledged to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which Libya ratified in 1975 , and to sign the Additional Protocol , which it did on 10 March 2004 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                         IAEA chief El Baradei indicated that signing the Protocol would ensure IAEA oversight over Libya 's nuclear transition from weapons creation to peaceful purposes .                                                                                                                                                   Previously , Libya signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in November 2001 and ratified it in January 2004 .                                                                                                                           In 1996 , it had signed the Treaty of Pelindaba which established a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa .                                                                                                            Besides previously secret nuclear sites disclosed in late 2003 , Libya possesses a Soviet-supplied 10 MW research reactor in Tajura .                                                                                                                                                             With the lifting of UN sanctions in 1998 , Russia renewed its nuclear cooperation with Libya , providing funding for renovations to the Taruja nuclear complex .                                                                                                                                          Excerpts from the Nuclear and Missile Developments Database                       Biological         In 2003 , Libya admitted its previous intentions to acquire equipment needed to produce biological weapons ( BW ) .                                                                                                                                                             In October and December 2003 , Libyan officials took US and UK experts to a number of medical and agricultural research centers that had the potential to be used in BW research .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The country acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention on 19 January 1982 .                                                                                                There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon ( CW ) plants at Rabta and Tarhunah could contain BW research facilities as well .                                                                                                                                                        Prior to Libya 's 19 December 2003 announcement to abandon its WMD programs , US intelligence agencies alleged that Qadhafi had attempted to recruit South African scientists to assist in the acquisition of BW , and that Libya had started to develop pathogens and toxins for weapons use .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Chemical         There is a significant amount of open-source literature concerning Libya 's acquisition and use of chemical weapons ( CW ) ; it is well documented that Libya employed Iranian-supplied mustard gas bombs against Chad , its southern neighbor , in 1987 .                                                                                                                                                                                                     In documentation provided to US and UK authorities in 2003 , Libya revealed a `` significant quantity '' of mustard agent produced more than 10 years ago at a facility near Rabta , located in the Sahara Desert about 120 km southwest of Tripoli , along with chemical munitions and equipment needed to establish a second CW production facility .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate all chemical weapons stocks and munitions and accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention `` without delay. ''                                                                                                                       Missile         Libya first acquired Scud-B missiles in the early 1970 s from the Soviet Union .                                                                                                                                                       In the early 1980 s , Libya accelerated its efforts to obtain a longer-range ballistic missile with the al-Fatah , reportedly with a range of 950 km .                                                                                                                                                       Germany and China allegedly provided technical and material assistance to the al-Fatah program .                                                                                                              The al-Fatah missile system has not been completed and remains untested .                                                                  In November 2000 , as part of a $600 million agreement , Libya allegedly acquired the first shipment of a total of 50 North Korean Nodong ballistic missiles , including launch capabilities .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   North Korea also allegedly provided more than 10 scientists to work on the Libyan missile program .                                                                                                                          This complemented other missile component shipments that reportedly began in 1999 .                                                                                                            Also , after the lifting of the 1999 sanctions , reports of increased technical and structural assistance from countries like Iran , North Korea , China , India , and Russia have raised concerns over Libya 's growing ability to manufacture ballistic missiles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 2003 , US experts were given access to Libya 's missile arsenal and to a number of missile research facilities .                                                                                                                                                         In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate ballistic missiles capable of traveling more than 300 km with payloads of 500 kg .
