The center , which has drawn criticism from arms control experts and local activists , will be the first department lab to focus strictly on biodefense .                                                                                                                                                                                    The laboratory 's mission , which will be split between two centers , is to understand current and future biological threats .

One of the biologists ' jobs , according to chief scientist Bernard Courtney , will be to create pathogens to match strains that terrorists are clandestinely producing and then develop vaccines and drugs to combat them .                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But some arms control specialists worry that the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center -- now operating out of borrowed lab space at the Frederick base and elsewhere -- might develop new vaccine - resistant or lethal microbes without solid evidence of a terrorist plot to unleash similar bugs .

In a leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip , the group , which belongs to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 's Fatah Party , said the weapons were the result of a three - year effort .                                                                                                                                                                              According to the statement , the first of its kind , the group has managed to manufacture and develop at least 20 different types of biological and chemical weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The group said its members would not hesitate to add the new weapons to Kassam rockets that are being fired at Israeli communities almost every day .                                                                                                                                                              It also threatened to use the weapons against IDF soldiers if Israel carried out its threats to invade the Gaza Strip .

Security sources have disclosed that the belief amongst most intelligence agencies is that a chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear ( CBRN ) attack , using a so-called dirty bomb , is now inevitable .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The warning comes three weeks after 250 police officers stormed the home of two Muslim brothers in Forest Gate , east London , in the mistaken belief that they were attempting to develop a chemical bomb .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It follows growing concern among members of Britain 's intelligence and security hierarchy that if a CBRN attack took place in the City of London it would devastate Britain 's economy and severely damage the economies of Europe and America .
