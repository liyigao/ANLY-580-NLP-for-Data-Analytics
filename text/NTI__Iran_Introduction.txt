   Introduction       Iran 's chemical weapons and ballistic missiles , and possibly its nuclear weapon program and biological warfare capabilities , are meant to deter opponents and to gain influence in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea regions .                                                                                                                                                                                                 The acquisition and creation of these various weapon systems can also be seen as a response to Iran 's own experience as a victim of chemical and missile attacks during the Iran - Iraq War .                                                                                                                                                                                                             Nuclear        Iran possesses five research reactors and two partially constructed power reactors at Bushehr .                                                                                                                             It acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) in 1970 .                                                        In the mid - 1970s , Iran initiated a nuclear power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .                                                                                                                                                                                          The 1979 revolution ended all nuclear efforts until 1984 , when Iran revived the nuclear power program and reportedly began covert procurement for a nuclear weapon program .                                                                                                                                                                                      Iran 's plans for building a civilian nuclear power program have prompted much concern regarding its intention to develop nuclear weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                     Russia is assisting Iran to construct a light water reactor at Bushehr , which is now nearing completion , and will supply the nuclear fuel needed to run it .                                                                                                                                                                            Although the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) allows transfers of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to non - nuclear weapon states , the United States has vehemently opposed the Russian - Iranian deal .                                                                                                                                                                                     The United States believes that nuclear energy is not necessary in a country with Iran 's large oil supply .                                                                                                                         It fears that the deal is being used as a cover for the transfer of more sensitive nuclear technology to Iran and to provide training for Iranian nuclear specialists that could be used to support a nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Russia , however , has expressed its intention to complete the deal .                                                                                    Iran has denied the charges that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and argues that nuclear technology for civilian use is the right of every non - nuclear weapon state party to the NPT .                                                                                                                                                                                             American concerns over Iran 's nuclear program intensified in mid - 2002 , when American intelligence learned of the existence of two secret nuclear facilities .                                                                                                                                                                             According to an Iranian opposition group , the two sites , a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant near Arak , had been funded by front companies .                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In February 2003 , Iranian leaders announced a new plan to develop a nuclear energy plan using entirely domestic resources .                                                                                                                                                                     This development is of particular concern , considering the revelation of the two secret facilities .                                                                                                                The United States believes that these facilities might contribute to Iran 's development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which would enable Iran to build nuclear weapons without importing nuclear material .                                                                                                                                                                                    Later in February 2003 , an IAEA delegation visited the pilot - scale gas centrifuge enrichment plant at Natanz , which is nearly ready for operation .                                                                                                                                          The inspection team learned that Iran has the capability to build more centrifuges .                                                                                                                         During the IAEA 's visit to Iran , Iranian officials indicated that Iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the IAEA , but did not clearly indicate Iran 's willingness to accept the Additional Protocol .                                                                                                                                                                                                       This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT ( as North Korea has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .                                                                                                                                                                                            It is possible that construction of the Natanz plant violated Iran 's IAEA safeguards obligations .                                                                                                                  Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .                                                                                                                                      Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Iran may have taken this step .                                                                                 Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .                                                                                                                                         An Iranian initiative to normalize relations was communicated to the United States in May 2003 .                                                                              It includes a promise to address U.S. concerns on nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting sanctions and eventual normalization of relations .                                                                                                                                                      To date , the United States has not responded to the offer .                                                          However , intense U.S. pressure for Iran to prove it had no secret atomic weapons program culminated in a toughly worded UN resolution in September 2003 , prompting a walkout and subsequent freeze on nuclear inspections by Iran .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In February 2004 , it was revealed that HEU traces detected by IAEA inspectors twelve months previously -- in at least two different sites -- were pure enough to produce nuclear weaponry .                                                                                                                                                                   In March 2004 , the revelation , combined with IAEA evidence that nuclear activities had been pursued on Iranian military bases , led to a first - ever acknowledgment by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani that the Iranian military had produced centrifuges to enrich uranium .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Iran continues to assert , however , that its nuclear program is for the generation of electricity alone .                                                                                                                 In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Iran agreed to an IAEA inspection schedule and to a mid - May 2004 deadline for the submission of complete details regarding its nuclear program and goals .                                                                                                                                                                   Biological       There is very little publicly available information to determine whether Iran is pursuing a biological weapon program .                                                                         Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The United States alleges that Iran may have started to develop small quantities of agent , possibly including mycotoxins , ricin , and the smallpox virus .                                                                                                                                                          Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing biological weapons .                                                                                Chemical        There is limited open - source information available concerning Iran 's chemical weapons program .                                                                                                             Although Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in November 1997 , the United States believes that Iran has maintained a chemical weapons program since 1984 , including production of sarin , mustard , phosgene , and hydrocyanic acid .                                                                                                                                                                                              According to U.S. government estimates , Iran can produce 1,000 metric tons of agent per year and may have a stockpile of at least several thousand metric tons of weaponized and bulk agent .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing chemical weapons .                                                                              Missile                 Iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the Middle East and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .                                                                                                                                                                                                              It has purchased North Korean Scud-Bs , Scud-Cs , and Nodong ballistic missiles .                                              Meanwhile , Iran has also developed short - range artillery rockets and is producing the Scud-B and the Scud-C -- called the Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 , respectively .                                                                                                                                                      Iran recently flight - tested the 1,300 km - range Shehab-3 , which is based on the North Korean Nodong .                                                                          The Shehab-3 is capable of reaching Israel .                                                     Following this most recent flight - test , the Shehab-3 was placed in service and revolutionary guard units were officially armed with the missiles .                                                                                                                 There are conflicting reports about the development of even longer - ranged missiles , such as the Shehab-4 and the Kosar intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) .                                                                                                                U.S. intelligence agencies assess that barring acquisition of a complete system or major subsystem from North Korea , Iran is unlikely to launch an ICBM or satellite launch vehicle ( SLV ) before mid - decade .                                                                                                                                                                                         At present , Iran 's capabilities in missile production have kept in line with its doctrine of protection from regional threats .                                                                                        Iran has developed new missiles including the Ra'ad and Kosar and continues to test its Nodong based , Shehab-3 missile .                                                                                                                                                              On October 20, 2004 , Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani confirmed the latest successful test of Iran 's Shehab-3 with a 2,000 - kilometer range in front of observers .                                                                                                                                      Iran has openly declared its ability to mass produce the Shehab-3 medium - range missile .                                                                                                                Intelligence reports regarding Iran 's expansion of capabilities and persistent interest in acquiring new technologies have led the United States to seek other options in dealing with Iran as a regional threat .
