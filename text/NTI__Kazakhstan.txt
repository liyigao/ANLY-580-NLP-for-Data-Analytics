   Introduction        Kazakhstan inherited nuclear-tipped missiles , a nuclear weapon test site , and biological and chemical weapon production facilities when the Soviet Union collapsed .                                                                                                                                                  In its first decade of independence , Kazakhstan dismantled and destroyed Soviet weapons systems and facilities left on its territory and signed several international nonproliferation treaties .                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Nuclear        When the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991 , Kazakhstan inherited 1,410 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear weapon test site .                                                                                                                Kazakhstan transferred all of these nuclear warheads to Russia by April 1995 and destroyed the nuclear testing infrastructure at Semipalatinsk by July 2000 .                                                                                                                                                              Weapons-grade nuclear material remains in Kazakhstan , however , including three metric tons of plutonium at a shutdown breeder reactor in western Kazakhstan and small amounts of highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) at two nuclear research institutes .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Approximately 600 kilograms of weapons-grade HEU was removed to the United States from the Ulba Metallurgy Plant in 1994 under a joint U.S. - Kazakhstani operation known as Project Sapphire .                                                                                                                                                               Kazakhstan is a party to START-I , the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) .                                                                                                                                  Biological        Kazakhstan has not declared an official policy against biological weapons ( BW ) .                                                         It has not signed the Biological Toxin and Weapons Convention ( BWC ) nor is it a member of the Australia Group .                                                                                                                           Kazakhstani President Nazarbayev , however , has declared Kazakhstan 's commitment to the nonproliferation of BW and associated technologies .                                                                                                                          In 1993 , Kazakhstan created a civilian body , the National Center for Biotechnology , to oversee the administration of most of the former BW facilities in Kazakhstan .                                                                                                                                                           These facilities include the following : Biomedpreparat , a large-scale anthrax production facility located in Stepnogorsk ; the Scientific Research Agricultural Institute ( SRAI ) at Otar , which specializes in anti-crop and anti-livestock diseases ; and Biokombinat , a small mobilization production facility located in Almaty , now producing vaccines .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections ( SCQZI ) ( formerly known as the Anti-Plague Institute ) was also involved in the Soviet BW system and is now under the jurisdiction of the Kazakhstani Ministry of Health .                                                                                                                                             Both SCQZI and SRAI house extensive collections of virulent strains .                                                                      Under Cooperative Threat Reduction ( CTR ) programs , Biomedpreparat has been dismantled and safety and security have been upgraded at SCQZI and SRAI .                                                                                                                            Chemical        Kazakhstan inherited one known chemical weapons ( CW ) production plant in the city of Pavlodar .                                                                                                                 This plant probably was designed to replace aging plants in Volgograd and Novocheboksarsk ( Russia ) for the production of the binary agent `` novichok .''                                                                                                                                                                       The plant 's construction was halted in 1987 , after the Soviet Union became involved in Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) -related negotiations , so it never produced any CW agents .                                                                                                                                                                                                         Kazakhstan joined the CWC in March 2000 .                                          However , Kazakhstan produced a nil declaration , leaving out the Pavlodar facility .                                                                           Missile        Kazakhstan inherited 104 SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) from the Soviet missile complex .                                                                         All ICBMs were transferred to Russia for dismantlement by September 1996 and missile silos and silo structures were destroyed under the U.S. Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction ( CTR ) program by September 1999 .                                                                                                                                                                                                  Gidromash , an Almaty -based Soviet-era producer of submarine-launched missiles , was converted to a civilian commercial enterprise under CTR 's Industrial Partnerships Program .
