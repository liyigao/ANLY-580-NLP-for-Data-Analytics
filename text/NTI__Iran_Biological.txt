   Overview        Iran is often accused in Western circles of secretly developing an offensive biological warfare ( BW ) program .                                                                                                                                                       In a 1996 report to the US Senate , the Central Intelligence Agency claimed that `` Iran has had a biological warfare program since the early 1980s .                                                                                                                                                                Currently the program is in its research and development stages , but we believe Iran holds some stocks of BW agents and weapons ... ''                                                                                                                                                          Iran has ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) and publicly decried all forms of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .                                                                                                      At the same time , it does have a very sophisticated biotechnology infrastructure that includes leading research facilities and trained personnel .                                                                                                                                                                            It has also participated in several scientific exchanges with foreign experts .                                                                                Iran has shown an interest in acquiring BW agents from foreign sources .                                                                                                    The speaker of the Iranian parliament publicly stated in 1988 that `` ... we should fully equip ourselves in defensive and offensive use of chemical , bacteriological , and radiological weapons . ''                                                                                                                                                                Canadian and Dutch scientists were approached by Iranian personnel looking to acquire mycotoxin - producing fungi ( Fusarium spp. ) in 1989 .                                                                                                                                                       Sources also claim that Iran has pursued the acquisition of castor beans ( known to be used for producing the deadly toxin ricin ) and retains several cultures of the anthrax - producing bacteria Bacillus anthracis .                                                                                                                                                                                     Given Iran 's strong biotechnology and pharmaceutical infrastructure , it is not difficult to envision the development of a concealed BW program .                                                                                                                                        Several dual - use items have been imported into Iran from Western countries , and Iran is also working closely with India and Cuba within the realm of biotechnology .                                                                                                                                                              History        Some Western sources believe that Iran first developed its BW program during the Iran - Iraq War ( 1980 - 88 ) .                                                                                                                             Currently , its growing biotechnology industry does have the potential to divert dual - use agents for illicit warfare purposes .                                                                                                                                                               There are several reasons why Iran would pursue a BW program , including establishing a deterrent against Iraq , establishing regional dominance , or developing an alternative to conventional weapons for asymmetric conflicts .                                                                                                                                                                      Some experts speculate that in its biological arsenal , Iran possess agents such as botulinum toxin , B. anthracis , and ricin .                                                                                    In the early 1980s , upon approval of the World Federation of Culture Collections , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Biotechnology set up a 600 - strain Persian Type Culture Collection to assist Iran 's biotechnology industry .                                                                                                                                                                    In August 1989 , Iran was accused of trying to purchase strains of Fusarium spp. from Canada and the Netherlands , which could be used to develop T-2 mycotoxin .                                                                                                                                                                    It is believed that the strains were destined for the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology and the Imam Reza Medical Center .                                                                            It must be noted that Dr . Bruno Schiefer , the Canadian toxicologist approached by Iran , was doubtful that Iran would use the strains for illicit BW purposes .                                                                                                                                                                               While the two strains of fusaria Iran requested are in fact dangerous to animal and human nervous systems , Schiefer contended that the toxins ( T-2 and related `` trichothecene mycotoxins '' ) produced by the fungi would not kill quickly enough to be an effective agent .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Contravening his own argument , however , Schiefer also speculated that the Iranians were most likely trying to acquire the fungi for defensive purposes , such as developing gas masks that would be protective in the event of its offensive use .                                                                                                                                                                                                  T-2 and other trichothecene mycotoxins are suspected components of `` yellow rain , '' which was allegedly used in battle by Communist regimes in Southeast Asia during the 1970s and early 1980s .                                                                                                                                 European firms have been targeted by Iranians for technology and equipment .                                                         In addition , it has been alleged that former Soviet bioweaponeers have been hired by Iran to specifically work on its BW arsenal .                                                                                                                 These scientists are supposedly experimenting with the causative agents of such diseases as Marburg , smallpox , plague , and tularemia .                                                                                                According to Michael Eisenstadt , Iran `` probably is researching such standard agents as anthrax and botulin toxin and it has shown interest in acquiring materials which could be used to produce ricin and mycotoxins . ''                                                                                                                                                                                      Another report indicates that `` Iran has ... conducted extensive research on more lethal active agents like anthrax , hoof and mouth disease , and biotoxins . ''                                                                                                                                                  It must be noted that this latter source , cited by Anthony Cordesman , can not be independently corroborated , and firsthand data on Iranian BW agents is unavailable in open sources .                                                                                                                                                       Agents and Delivery          Some of the most common agents that are associated with the Iranian BW program in the open literature are B. anthracis , botulinum toxin , ricin , T-2 mycotoxin , and Variola virus , the causative agent of smallpox .                                                                                                                                                                       A table of cultures that Iran is known to possess is available in the Biological Capabilities section .                                                                                             With respect to delivery of any BW agent , it is not immediately clear what route Iran has taken or will take .                                                                                 Some experts believe that Iran is developing the capability to deliver biological agents by Scud missiles , aircraft , or other aerosolization techniques .                                                                                                                                 According to the CIA , Iran possesses weaponized biological agents that could be dispersed by artillery and aerial bombs .                                                                                                                      The Iranian Shahab missile is reportedly capable of carrying biological warheads .                                                                                    Iran has also conducted chemical and biological defense military exercises with helicopter sprayers and worked with cruise and ballistic missiles , although there is no concrete evidence that it has developed a biological warhead to be fit on such missiles .                                                                                                                                                                                                               Status        Iran does have technological sophistication in the biopharmaceutical industries and produces a variety of vaccines for humans and livestock .                                                                                        The Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines and the Pasteur Institute are leading regional facilities in the development and manufacture of vaccines .                                                                                                        In January 1997 , Iran created an organization called the Iranian Biotechnology Society ( IBS ) , which serves as an umbrella organization to bring together various institutes and individuals focusing on biotechnology related research .                                                                                                                                                                                            IBS has several branches and over 350 members .                                                   As there is no concrete mechanism for verifying government reports or allegations from exile groups , many of the allegations regarding the Iranian BW program remain unsubstantiated .                                                                                                                                                                                   Most of the literature and accusations come from CIA reports , uncited writings of experts , and claims made by Iranian dissidents .                                                                                                                    The majority of these reports cite Iranian attempts to purchase fusaria from Canada and the Netherlands as evidence that Iran is working on a covert weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                           While this could be true , it should be noted that the utility of these fungal species is not limited to BW applications .                                                                                     For instance , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology claims it researches Fusarium spp. to fight agricultural ailments in sunflower , tomato , and tobacco fields .                                                                                                                          Also , Iran offered one of its premier facilities , the Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines , to host mock inspections for the BWC .                                                                        If covert activities had in fact been taking place at this location , these inspections would have significantly jeopardized such efforts .                                                                                                                                Research of publicly released information from Iranian scientific institutions shows no concrete proof of an offensive BW program .                                                                                                                  However , the available information does not disprove allegations made by a variety of sources .                                                                                               The sophisticated research facilities in Iran could easily serve as a front for illicit BW - related activities and offer a legitimate excuse to import dual - use material .                                                                                                                                                                                                      Before the 1990 Gulf War , Iraq had used its single cell protein research program at al-Hakam to camouflage its development of biological agents , including B. anthracis .                                                                                                                                               Similar , presumably legitimate advanced research is being carried out at the National Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology near Tehran .                                                                                                                Even if Iran possesses these biological agents , it faces a significant challenge in their weaponization and delivery .                                                                                           There is no indication that Iran has successfully weaponized BW agents .                                                                           Given its current state of technology and the problems associated with delivering a sophisticated BW agent , it is unlikely that Iran currently has the means to carry out a significant biological attack .                                                                                                                                                                                               Capabilities        Overview        Iran has one of the most advanced biotech industries in the developing world , and has long been recognized as a leader in Southwest Asia in the fields of vaccine research and production .                                                                                                                                                                                           Agricultural Biotechnology :          One of Iran 's primary biotech focuses is research on agricultural science .                                                   In this field , Iran 's research is concentrated in creating genes that produce toxins against insect pests ; improving the biological resistance of plants ; formulating new pesticides ; improving techniques of spraying or otherwise disseminating pesticides ; investigating the effects on native plant species after they have been introduced to various pests and diseases ; preventing the production of mycotoxins in crops ; producing plant viruses and their corresponding antiserums for an antiserum bank ; and manufacturing pheromones and hormones to combat arthropods that harm Iran 's agricultural industry .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                All of these research areas have legitimate and important uses for improving crop yields and reducing the threat to Iran 's agricultural industry posed by pests and disease .                                                                                                                                                                              However , the expertise , equipment , and methodologies involved are intrinsically dual - use , and thus could conceivably be applied for illicit purposes if so desired .                                                                                                                                          Genetic Engineering and Vaccine Production :             Iran maintains three important facilities for research on combating the spread of disease .                                                                              Two of these facilities , the Pasteur Institute and the National Research Center of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( NRCGEB ) , focus primarily on diseases affecting human beings , while the third facility , the Razi Institute for Serum and Vaccines focuses on diseases affecting both humans and other animals such as livestock .                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Razi and Pasteur Institutes have vaccine development and production experience dating back to the 1920s , and for many years both of these facilities were recognized among the most advanced of their kind in the developing world .                                                                                                                                                                                                    Today , all three facilities undertake projects requiring advanced microbiology and genetic engineering equipment and expertise that could be applied toward the production of biological weapons .                                                                                                                                                              For instance , the NRCGEB 's research in recombinant DNA technologies , genetic engineering , and DNA vaccine production could conceivably be utilized to increase the virulence or resistance of select pathogens .                                                                                                                                  The equipment for mass - producing vaccines and antiserums at the Pasteur Institute could be utilized to mass - produce biological weapons as well .                                                                                                                      As is evident from the contents of the Persian Type Culture Collection discussed below , Iran clearly has access to many dangerous pathogens .                                                                              Furthermore , Iran clearly possesses technology useful for producing biological weapons ( as will be elucidated in the Facilities section of this profile ) .                                                                                                                                   What remains unclear is whether Iran is indeed proceeding with a BW program .                                                                                         Like many facilities throughout the United States and Western Europe that have similar or even more advanced capabilities , these facilities are open to public scrutiny .                                                                                                                                                                               Also , like many facilities in the West , Iran 's leading biotechnology research and development facilities create valuable vaccine products that are distributed in Iran and throughout the world .                                                                                                                                                                                         Facilities        Amir Kabir University of Technology                  Other Names : Tehran Polytechnic ; Amirkabir University of Technology                                        Address : Hafez Ave. , No. 424 , P.O. Box 15875-4413 Tehran , Iran                                     Subordinate to : Ministry of Culture and Higher Education                         Size :          At present , Amir Kabir University ( AKU ) has 7000 students in undergraduate and post - graduate programs .                                                                      It has 14 engineering departments , five research centers , and an associate university complex located at the town of Tafresh near Tehran .                                                                                                                                                           AKU employs 480 full - time teachers and 550 administrative employees .                                                                   Primary Function : Education , development of post - graduate studies , expansion of industrial and academic links , and establishment of new research laboratories .                                                                                                                                                                           History :          Founded in 1958 , AKU underwent a series of reforms after the revolution to align its teachings with Islamic principles .                                                                                  The first independent biomedical engineering department in Iran was established at AKU in October 1993 .                                                                      Activities :          AKU 's Biomedical Engineering Department offers graduate programs in three major specialties -- Bioelectrics , Biomaterials , and Biomechanics -- which incorporate traditional engineering programs to address problems associated with human physiology , treatment , and rehabilitation .                                                                                                                                    AKU 's Biomaterials Laboratory is the largest university laboratory fostering research in the area of synthesis , processing , and modification of materials for use in biological environments .                                                                                                                                                                                    This laboratory is especially active in the area of polymeric materials with the objective of modifying the physical , chemical , biological , and mechanical properties of polymeric materials to render them biocompatible .                                                                                                                                                                          The laboratory 's specific research areas include the design and processing of systems for controlled and targeted delivery of bioactive agents .                                                                                                                            The university places emphasis on its strong relationship with the nation 's industries and the practical application of its training programs .                                                                                                                                According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran , Iran has purchased dual - use equipment using the science and technology center at Amir Kabir University as a cover .                                                                                                                                                                            Middle East Defense News reports that AKU has been used as a front company to purchase the following equipment from the United States : computers , Unix software , and training from NCR , Apple Computer , and Sun Microsystems , and neutron - shielding from Reactor Experiments , Inc . None of these technologies appears to be directly related to biological weapons .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Additional Info :            In 2002 , AKU and Damascus University signed a mutual scientific cooperation agreement that called for broadened scientific , educational , and research cooperation between the universities , the exchange of professors and students , the organization of scientific seminars and educational courses , and the formation of a joint working committee to probe into the inauguration of a branch of Amir Kabir University in Syria .
