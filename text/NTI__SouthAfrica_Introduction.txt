   Introduction       South Africa 's nuclear , biological , chemical , and missile programs reflected perceptions of internal and external threats stemming from its former government 's policy of apartheid , as well as the country 's advanced state of technical development .                                                                                                                                                          Pretoria developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles but relinquished these armaments in the early 1990s .                                                                                                  The apartheid government also undertook a chemical and biological weapons ( CBW ) defense program , which reportedly also included offensive research and use of CBW agents against opponents of that government .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While the proliferation legacies of South Africa 's nuclear and missile programs were effectively resolved through verified disarmament measures that won international acclaim , dismantlement of the country 's CBW capabilities was not verified to a comparable degree of certainty .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The post - apartheid government of South Africa implemented its nonproliferation and disarmament policy through the Non - Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act ( No. 87 of 1993 ) to control the transfer of sensitive items and technologies .                                                                                                                                                                   South Africa is the first and , to date , only country to build a nuclear arsenal , and then voluntarily dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program .                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The South African experience demonstrates that at least under some conditions , unilateral disarmament is not only possible , but can improve a nation 's security .                                                                                                                                              Nuclear       In the 1960s , South Africa began to explore the technical utility of `` peaceful nuclear explosions '' for mining and engineering purposes .                                                                                           In 1973 , then Prime Minister Johannes Vorster approved a program to develop a limited nuclear deterrent capability .                                                                                                                             Ultimately , South Africa manufactured six air - deliverable nuclear weapons of the `` gun - type '' design .                                                                                              In parallel with decisions to end apartheid , the government halted the bomb program in 1989 and dismantled existing weapons and associated production equipment .                                                                                                                                                                                                South Africa acceded to the Treaty on the Non - Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) as a non - nuclear weapon state in 1991 , and International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspectors subsequently verified the completeness of its nuclear dismantlement .                                                                                                                                                                                                                    South Africa joined the Zangger Committee in 1994 and the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 1995 .                                                                                        South Africa was instrumental in winning indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 , and played a leading role in successful conclusion of the 2000 NPT Review Conference as a member of the `` New Agenda Coalition '' that also included Brazil , Egypt , Ireland , Mexico , New Zealand , and Sweden .                                                                                                                                                                                                 More recently , South Africa began working more closely with the IAEA in 2004 , in order to monitor international smuggling of nuclear weapons materials , after investigations of a South African businessman exposed connections to the A.Q. Khan network .                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In 2004 , there was also ample discussion concerning South Africa 's dwindling coal reserves and its need for additional nuclear power generation .                                                                                                                                                                                     Biological       South Africa 's biological weapons program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast ( later Project Jota ) .                                                                                                                                                                                               Personnel associated with Coast have characterized it as the most sophisticated program of its type outside of the former Soviet Union , but international CBW experts generally consider it to have been considerably less advanced from a scientific standpoint .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes , since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use -- if not already using -- CW agents against the South African Defence Force ( SADF ) , from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It was in this highly charged political and military context , which precipitated a `` bunker '' or `` laager '' mentality , that Coast was secretly initiated in 1981 under the aegis of the SADF Special Forces .                                                                                                                     The chief facility for researching , producing , and testing BW agents and lethal toxic chemicals was a military front company called Roodeplaat Research Laboratories , located north of Pretoria , and other facilities were established to develop protective clothing and manufacture exotic assassination devices .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .                                                                                                                       During its existence Coast scientists tested or developed a wide range of harmful BW agents , including Bacillus anthracis , botulinum toxin , Vibrio cholerae , Clostridium perfringens , plague bacteria , and salmonella bacteria .                                                                                                                                                                      Some of these pathogens were probably used to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state , '' and it is alleged that both anthrax bacteria and V. cholerae were each employed on at least one occasion to infect larger populations .                                                                                                                                                                    The CBW program was officially dismantled in 1993 , in the midst of a liberalizing transformation of the regime .                                                                                                     There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .                                                                   The extent to which various foreign governments , military establishments , and intelligence agencies secretly monitored or covertly assisted in the development of the program likewise remains an open question .                                                                                                                                                                                                      Chemical        South Africa 's chemical warfare program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast ( later Project Jota ) .

The chief facility for researching and producing CW agents was a military front company called Delta G Scientific , located between Johannesburg and Pretoria , and several other facilities were set up to develop protective clothing , manufacture exotic assassination devices , and `` weaponize '' irritants ( Riot Control Agents such as CS and CR ) and incapacitants by placing them in artillery shells , mortar bombs , and grenades .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .                                                                                                                          During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Several of these latter , above all the toxic organophosphates , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state . ''                                                                                                                Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone ( `` Quaaludes '' ) , MDMA ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , LSD , marijuana extract ( tetrahydrocannibol ) , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The CBW program was officially dismantled in 1993 , in the midst of a liberalizing transformation of the regime .                                                                                                     There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .                                                                   The extent to which various foreign governments , military establishments , and intelligence agencies secretly monitored or covertly assisted in the development of the program likewise remains an open question .                                                                                                                                                                                                        Missile                 It is not clear when South Africa began ballistic missile - related efforts , but reportedly by the mid - 1980s , some missile infrastructure existed in the country .                                                                                                                                                                                                      It appears that Israel collaborated with South Africa in development of this program , but the nature and extent of this relationship is unknown .                                                                                                       Following a July 1989 flight - test of what Pretoria described as a `` booster rocket '' in a space - launch program , U.S. intelligence noted striking similarities between this system and Israel 's intermediate - range Jericho - 2 ballistic missile .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Facing U.S. opposition to missile proliferation and the end of its apartheid government , South Africa abandoned its missile and space launch programs in 1991 and dismantled associated facilities under international observation .                                                                                                                                                                                                                     South Africa became a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) in 1995 .
