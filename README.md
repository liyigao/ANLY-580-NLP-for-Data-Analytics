## Project

*A Comparison of Modern Spam Detection Techniques on Text Messages*

Spam detection has become an important challenge for companies that provide communication services. The most basic spam detection algorithm is Na√Øve Bayes classifier, which is a baseline for other algorithms, and it can deal with limited training datasets. Modern data scientists have gone further and use many other machine learning or deep learning techniques on this task, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis and Recurrent Neural Network. We show that both performs better than baseline model with 4-8 percentages improvement.
