Computers$0.99 understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers Georgetown University, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to Tom analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literatu$1re on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term{document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal iSep 21st, 2018n this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who9/21/2018 are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.
