The processing disadvantage of verbs compared to nouns and the greater vulnerability of verbs in brain damage
have been ascribed to greater processing demands of morpho-syntactical or/and semantic properties for verbs,
or/and visual complexity in picture-naming studies. Using picture naming, the current functional magnetic
resonance imaging study examined the neural substrates underlying the semantic distinction between nouns and
verbs. Under forced (externally-elicited) or free (internally-motivated) conditions, participants named a set of
pictorial stimuli as objects or actions performed on/with the objects in Chinese. Use of a language with impoverished
inflectional morphology (i.e., Chinese) and the same set of pictures for naming objects and actions
allows for the control of both morpho-syntactical and visual confounds. The results revealed specific neural
correlates for action verbs in the cortical-subcortical motor system, irrespective of the naming conditions.
Plausible accounts for the motor aspects of action-verb processing were interpreted basically on a semantic basis.
1. Introduction
Nouns and verbs, across all human languages, are two of the earliest
acquired and the most extensively studied grammatical classes. Nouns
and verbs differ systematically at different linguistic levels. At the semantic
level, the two grammatical classes are distinguished between
the concepts of objects (or entities) and the concepts of actions (or
events) (Bird, Howard, & Franklin, 2000; Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, &
Garrett, 2004). Syntactically and morphologically, verbs are more
complex than nouns in most languages (Friedmann, Wenkert-Olenik, &
Mali, 2000; Vigliocco et al., 2006). For example, some Indo-European
languages rich in inflectional morphology have complex inflectional
systems in number, tense, aspect, mood and gender.
Converging evidence has demonstrated more demands of cognitive
resources for verb processing than noun processing and greater vulnerability
of verbs in brain damage (for reviews see Mätzig, Druks,
Masterson, & Vigliocco, 2009; Vigliocco, Vinson, Druks, Barber, &
Cappa, 2011). In children’s language acquisition, verbs tend to be more
difficult to learn than nouns (Bornstein & Cote, 2005). Moreover, behavioral
studies have reported worse naming performance for verbs
than nouns in neurologically intact participants using picture naming
(e.g., Bogka et al., 2003; Cotelli, Manenti, Brambilla, Zanetti, &
Miniussi, 2012; Szekely et al., 2005). Evidence from clinical neuropsychology
has demonstrated a higher incidence of a verb disproportionate
deficit. According to a review of 38 papers based on
picture naming performance of 280 aphasic patients with focal brain
damage, a relative verb deficit (75%) was far more frequently reported
than a relative noun deficit (11%), with some patients (14%) showing
no noun-verb difference (Mätzig et al., 2009). A verb disproportionate
deficit was also systematically observed in patients with progressive
lesions such as PD (Parkinson’s disease) (Bertella et al., 2001; Cotelli,
Manenti, Brambilla, & Borroni, 2017; Péran et al., 2009; Péran et al.,
2013).
Functional neuroimaging literature has observed, though considerably
overlapping, partially separable neural networks between
noun and verb processing. A body of studies showed greater verb-specific
activations not only in the left prefrontal areas (e.g., Liljeström
et al., 2008; Tsigka, Papadelis, Braun, & Miceli, 2014; Yu, Law, Han,
Zhu, & Bi, 2011), but also in the left middle temporal gyrus, parietal
lobe, fusiform and premotor cortex (e.g., Berlingeri et al., 2008;

Liljeström et al., 2008; Momenian, Nilipour, Samar, Oghabian, &
Cappa, 2016; Tranel, Martin, Damasio, Grabowski, & Hichwa, 2005; Yu
et al., 2011). In contrast, only a few studies demonstrated noun-specific
activations in the left temporal lobe and other brain regions (e.g.,
Fujimaki et al., 1999; Shapiro, Moo, & Caramazza, 2006; Shapiro et al.,
2005; Siri et al., 2008). The observation of greater cortical activation
for verbs, anyhow, stands in a position which is compatible with the
aforementioned evidence that verbs are more demanding to process
than nouns.
The general processing disadvantage of verbs has been accounted
for by two overarching views. A morpho-syntactic view assumes that
different morpho-syntactic processes between nouns and verbs are
computed in partially segregated neural circuits (Shapiro & Caramazza,
2003a, 2003b; Shapiro, Shelton, & Caramazza, 2000). In languages rich
in inflectional morphology, verbs are morphologically and syntactically
more complex than nouns. As a result, verbs are more demanding to
process than nouns. Alternatively, a semantic view argues that the
observed noun or verb disproportionate deficit is in fact a reflection of
an underlying segregation between object and action concepts
(Berlingeri et al., 2008; Crepaldi, Berlingeri, Paulesu, & Luzzatti, 2011;
Pulvermüller, Mohr, & Schleichert, 1999; Vigliocco et al., 2011). As
linguistic representations are organized by sensorimotor experience
(Barsalou, Simmons, Barbey, & Wilson, 2003; Hauk, Johnsrude, &
Pulvermüller, 2004; Pulvermüller, 2005), nouns and verbs have distinct
semantic properties.
Actually, nouns and verbs are deemed to dissociate along the
morpho-syntactic dimension or/and semantic dimension (for reviews
see Crepaldi et al., 2011; Mätzig et al., 2009; Vigliocco et al., 2011). In
some Indo-European languages, nouns and verbs carry heavy morphological
loads. For example, Saccuman et al. (2006) asked participants
to name pictures as objects or actions in Italian, a language with
more than 90 possible inflected verb forms but only 4 possible inflected
noun forms. Chinese, however, is a language with virtually no inflectional
morphology, i.e., no verb conjugations and no noun declensions
(Bates, Chen, Tzeng, Li, & Opie, 1991). An example to show absence of
inflectional markers in Chinese is that there are no plural forms for
Chinese countable nouns. For “NIAN”  which means “year”, “YINIAN”
 and “LIANG-NIAN“ are respectively equivalent to
“one year” and “two years”. As the naming language in studies addressing
the noun-verb dissociation is usually rich in inflectional morphology,
a logical inference follows that the processing disadvantage of
verbs in a language with impoverished inflectional morphology may be
interpreted basically on a semantic basis.
Within the semantic framework, one of the semantic complexities
for verbs under discussion is that the processing of action verbs is believed
to involve the motor system (Pulvermüller, 2005). A close link
between language deficits and motor impairment has been well documented
in patients with movement disorders (e.g., Cardona et al., 2013;
Cotelli et al., in press; Péran et al., 2009). For example, using picture
naming, an fMRI study with non-demented PD patients found positive
correlations between the severity of the motor deficit and brain activities
in the pre- and post-central gyri bilaterally, left supplementary
motor area, left frontal operculum and right superior temporal cortex
during action naming (Péran et al., 2009). The findings from patients
with PD, clinically characterized by movement disorders, have provided
strong evidence for the role of the motor system in action naming.
Given the noun-verb dissociation discussed in the literature is
mostly based on picture naming performance (for reviews see Cotelli
et al., in press; Mätzig et al., 2009; Vigliocco et al., 2011), the current
study focused mainly on picture naming. Within this context, it is
surprising that the motor features of action verbs have so far been little
illustrated in imaging studies which addressed the noun-verb dissociation
in neurologically intact participants using picture naming
(Berlingeri et al., 2008; Damasio et al., 2001; Liljeström et al., 2008;
Momenian et al., 2016; Saccuman et al., 2006; Siri et al., 2008; Tranel
et al., 2005). Rather, those studies have yielded mixed results which can
be attributed to, except for morpho-syntactic factors, various unmatched
psycholinguistic variables.
Visual processing demands may be a striking confounding variable
in picture naming. In most studies (e.g., Berlingeri et al., 2008; Mätzig
et al., 2009; Momenian et al., 2016), the use of two completely different
sets of pictures (i.e., object pictures and action pictures) is problematic
due to between-set incomparability in visual processing demands
(Liljeström et al., 2008). For example, in Mätzig and colleagues’ study
(2009), the action pictures have significant higher visual complexity
than the object picture. Therefore, the processing disadvantage for
verbs may be due to greater processing demands of visual-spatial loads
from action pictures, but not to verb processing per se (Liljeström et al.,
2008; Pillon & d'Honincthun, 2010). Several studies have used a set of
pictorial stimuli for naming in order to lessen confounds from visual
processing demands (Hernandez, Dapretto, Mazziotta, & Bookheimer,
2001; Liljeström et al., 2008; Siri et al., 2008). However, the use of
action pictures to name objects in the aforementioned studies may lead
to naming uncertainties. For example, Hernandez et al. (2001) asked
participants to name an action picture “to light the candle” as an object.
Actually, possible candidates for object naming here include “candle”,
“hand”, “match’, and even “flame”. An alternative approach, therefore,
is to use the same set of object pictures for naming objects or actions
performed on/with the objects.
Notably, aphasic patients or healthy participants in typical laboratory
paradigms were externally required to name pictures as objects or
actions, whereas the interlocutor in a naturally occurring context of
language production has free options to produce internally intended
concepts in response to a pictorial stimulus. Neuroimaging studies of
externally versus internally guided word production (Crosson et al.,
2001; Tremblay & Gracco, 2006) and language switching with production
tasks (Blanco-Elorrieta & Pylkkänen, 2017; Zhang et al., 2015)
demonstrated the differences between the mechanisms underlying
language production in typical laboratory (i.e., forced) contexts and
that in more naturally occurring (i.e., free or voluntary) contexts.
Therefore, how noun-verb distinction changes with different naming
contexts remains unknown. What’s more, studies of brain-damaged
patients showed evidence for a close link between aphasia and movement
disorders, suggesting the role of the motor system in the processing
of action verbs (for a review see Cotelli et al., in press). Notably,
dysfunctions of voluntary action are features of patients with movement
disorders (Haggard, 2008). Thus, an endeavor to explore language
production under forced and free (or voluntary) conditions may provide
complementary information for empirical and clinical studies on the
processing disadvantage of verbs with picture naming paradigms.
In the current study (i) we were interested in the brain regions activated
during the processing of action verbs relative to that of object
nouns when both morph-syntactic and visual processing demands were
controlled; (ii) we wanted to find out if patterns of verb-versus-noun
brain activation would remain consistent independent of free (internally
motivated) or forced (externally elicited) naming conditions. We
adopted a factorial design in which, under forced or free conditions,
neurologically intact participants named the same set of pictorial stimuli
as objects or actions performed on/with the objects in Chinese
(Péran et al., 2009). Chinese is a language characterized by impoverished
inflectional morphology (Bates et al., 1991). Thus, using
Chinese as the naming language is expected to minimize morpho-syntactic
confounds (Yu et al., 2011). Moreover, by using the same set of
object pictures for naming objects or actions performed on/with the
objects under different naming conditions, any differences couldn’t be
attributed to visual processing demands (Siri et al., 2008; Vigliocco
et al., 2011).

2. Method
2.1. Participants
Twenty-one native Chinese speakers (11 females and 10 males,
mean age=21.7, SD=2.08) from the community of Southwest
University, China, were recruited in the experiment. All participants
were right-handed using Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield, 1971) with
normal or corrected-to-normal vision. No participant had a history of
major medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorder. Informed consent
was obtained from each participant in accordance with the guidelines
approved by the research ethical committee of Southwest University in
China. The imaging data of four participants were excluded from the
analysis: three due to excessive movement (> 2.5mm or 2.5° within
one run) and one due to failure to follow task instructions to perform
the tasks under free conditions (i.e., the number of response rates for
object or action naming was less than 60% of the average). Thus, data
from 17 participants (11 females and 6 males, mean age=22.1,
SD=2.63) were included in the final data analyses.
2.2. Materials
Sixty black-and-white line drawings were selected from the
Snodgrass and Vanderwart’s (1980) set as naming materials (see full
version of materials in Appendix). The psycholinguistic characteristics
of the pictorial stimuli were derived from Chinese version of Snodgrass
and Vanderwart’s Naming Battery (Zhang & Yang, 2003) on a 5-point
scale (1=very unfamiliar/unagreeable/incomplex, 5=very familiar/
agreeable/complex), with familiarity (4.5 ± 0.6), image agreement
(3.5 ± 1.2) and visual complexity (2.3 ± 0.9).
2.3. Design and task
Participants were instructed to covertly name the same set of pictures
as objects or as actions performed on/with the object (e.g., 自行
车-骑(bike-ride),风筝-放(kite-fly),苹果-吃(apple-eat)) under forced or
free conditions. Therefore, the task followed a 2 (naming type: object
naming versus action naming)×2 (naming condition: forced versus
free) within-subjects factorial design. Three cues were used with “N”
and “V” for forced condition and “O” for free condition. Under a forced
condition, the participants were required to name a picture as an object
when the cue is “N” (forced object naming) or an action when the cue is
“V” (forced action naming). Under a free condition when the cue is “O”
(free object or action naming), the participants had freedom to name a
picture as an object or an action. Following the instruction for free
conditions as done by Arrington and Logan (Arrington & Logan, 2004),
we required the participants to name pictures as objects or actions
equally often and in a random order.
An event-related design was adopted in the current study with four
runs. A total of 60 pictorial stimuli (object pictures) were equally divided
into four sets with each set cued respectively by “N”, “V”, “O” and
“O”. In the four runs, a Latin square was built for the set order so that
each set appeared once with a different cue in each run (namely, N-V-OO
for Run1, V-O-N-O for Run2, O-O-V-N for Run3 and O-N-O-V for
Run4). Then the trial sequences in each run were jittered and optimized
using the GA algorithm (Wager & Nichols, 2003) and remained fixed for
every participant. Thus, each pictorial stimulus was repeated four times
but with no one repeated in the same run.
2.4. Procedure
Each trial began with a 250-ms fixation cross, followed by a visual
cue (“N”, “V” or “O”) for 250 ms. A picture was then displayed for
1500 ms. Each trial was followed by a jittered inter-stimulus interval
(ISI) of 1000, 2000 or 3000 ms. For each trial, participants were asked
to name a picture covertly according to the cue once they viewed the
picture. Due to technical constraints that precluded the recording of
verbal responses, participants were asked to perform synchronous
manual responses while naming. Half of the participants were required
to press a button by self-monitoring their naming response type, with
left thumb for object naming and right thumb for action naming. This
task-to-hand assignment was reversed for the other half of the participants.
All participants underwent 3 sessions. A practice session outside the
scanner was first conducted. Participants named each of sixty pictorial
stimuli as an object and then as an action performed on/with the object.
During action naming, there is usually naming disagreement. For example,
a picture depicting an apple may be named as an action “peel”
or “eat”. To avoid naming uncertainties, the naming practice was performed
three times in order to reduce uncertainties about the target
response (Berlingeri et al., 2008). Each participant was asked to remain
consistent in naming words which first came into his/her mind while
viewing the picture. After the naming practice, sixteen additional pictures
were used to familiarize with the experimental procedure. During
the scanning session, participants completed four experimental runs.
Afterwards, outside the scanner, a behavioral session followed with the
identical pictorial stimuli and experimental procedure as done during
the scanning session (Abutalebi et al., 2013; Momenian et al., 2016).
The participants’ verbal naming responses were collected with the Serial
Response Box (SRBox, model 200a, Psychology Software Tools Inc.,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
2.5. Behavioral data analysis
Participants’ response times (RT) and accuracies were respectively
collected in and out of the scanner. We separately analyzed the two sets
of behavioral data. Within each set of data, we conducted a 2 (naming
type: object/action)×2 (naming condition: forced/free) within-subjects
repeated-measures ANOVA for the RTs and error rates, respectively.
Moreover, direct comparisons of object and action naming under
forced and free conditions were respectively performed using pair-wise
t-tests.
2.6. fMRI data acquisition and processing
MRI scans were acquired on a Siemens 3.0T Trio scanner using a 12-
channel transmit/receive gradient head coil (Southwest University,
China). An echo planer imaging with gradient echo (EPI GRE) sequence
was applied to acquire the blood oxygen level-dependent signals (flip
angel=90°, TR=2000 ms, T=30 ms, FOV=64×64mm2, 32 interleaved
descending slices, voxel size=3.44×3.44×3.00mm3 with
1-mm intra-slice gap). Anatomical reference images were also acquired
for each participant with a 3-D GRE T1-weighted sequence
(TR=1900 ms, TE=2.52 ms, flip angle=9°, FOV=256×256mm2,
voxel size=1×1×1mm3).
Data preprocessing and analysis were performed using SPM12
(Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.
fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and implemented on MATLAB version 2012a).
The first 10 volumes of each run were discarded to minimize the
transition effects of hemodynamic responses. The remaining functional
images were corrected for slice timing with the middle slice as reference,
and then realigned to remove head motion. Data were then
normalized to a standard template in the Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) space. Prior to statistical analysis, all images were
smoothed with an isotropic 8-mm full-width-half-maximal Gaussian
kernel. Time-series from each voxel were high-pass filtered (1/128 Hz
cutoff) to remove low-frequency noise and signal drift.
At the first level, the preprocessed functional volumes were submitted
to fixed-effects analyses for each participant, with the general
linear model applied at each voxel across the whole brain. Four variables
(i.e., forced object naming, forced action naming, free object
naming and free action naming) were entered into the model. The
Y. Zhang et al. Brain and Language 179 (2018) 22–32
24
BOLD response for each event was modeled with the canonical hemodynamic
response function along with the time derivative. Six parameter
estimates of head motion were entered as confound regressors in
the first-level single-subject design matrices to correct for potential
movement artifacts. In addition, the reaction time was entered as a
confound regressor to exclude button-pressing artifacts.
To generalize statistical inferences to the population level, a 2×2
within-subjects flexible factorial design was applied at the second-level
analysis. The contrast images derived from the first-level analyses were
entered into the model in a subject-wise fashion. First, we examined the
main effects of the two factors (naming type and naming condition). We
then obtained the interaction effect. To further examine if the nounverb
dissociation changed with different naming contexts, we analyzed
the simple effects of object versus action naming under free conditions
and forced conditions. All of the resulting statistical maps were set to a
significant threshold of p < 0.001, corrected for false discovery rate
(FDR). An extent threshold of 20 contiguous voxels was applied to all
contrasts.
3. Results
3.1. Behavioral results
Wrong naming, naming emendation, no responses and extreme slow
or fast responses (more than 3 SDs) were labeled as response errors. As
demonstrated in Table 1, similar patterns of RT results were exhibited
by the participants in and out of the scanner. The results showed significant
main effects of naming type (in-scanner: F(1,16)=21.38,
p < 0.001; out-scanner: F(1,16)=32.83, p < 0.001) and naming
condition (in-scanner: F(1,16)=18.18, p=0.001; out-scanner: F
(1,16)=17.11, p=0.001), but no significant interactions between
them. The results of error analysis showed main effects of naming type
(F(1,16)=9.48, p=0.007) and naming condition (F(1,16)=20.42,
p < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F(1,16)=8.38, p=0.011)
in the scanner, while there was a main effect of naming condition (F
(1,16)=9.48, p=0.007), but no main effect of naming type (F
(1,16)=2.01, p=0.175) and no significant interaction (F
(1,16)=0.22, p=0.643) out of the scanner. For the RT analysis, action
naming (in-scanner: 914 ms; out-scanner: 866 ms) was overall
slower than object naming (in-scanner: 876 ms; out-scanner: 819 ms).
For the error analysis, action naming (in-scanner: 3.1%; out-scanner:
2.2%) had higher error rates than object naming (in-scanner: 1.8%; outscanner:
1.7%).
3.2. Imaging results
The results showed significant main effects of naming type and
naming condition, but no interaction between them (p < 0.001, FDR
corrected). The main effect of naming type demonstrated that action
naming compared to object naming elicited activations in the precental
gyrus (BA 4/6), supplementary motor area (BA 6) and insula (BA 13)
and thalamus in the left hemisphere and right precentral gyrus (BA 6)
whereas no significant activations were observed when object naming
was compared to action naming (see Table 2 and Fig. 1). These activated
areas were associated with the motor network, suggesting the
role of the motor system in the processing of action verbs. In addition,
bilateral temporal gyri (BA 21/22) were activated when comparing
action naming to object naming. The simple effect of verb-specific activation
under forced naming conditions was observed in the left precentral
gyrus (BA 4/6), supplementary motor area (BA 6), insula (BA
13), thalamus and bilateral temporal gyri (BA 21/22). The simple effect
of verb-specific activation under free naming conditions was observed
in the left precentral gyrus (BA 4/6), insula (BA 13) and thalamus (see
Table 2 and Fig. 2).
Free versus forced condition demonstrated significant responses in
the bilateral middle frontal gyri, superior/inferior parietal lobule,
middle/inferior temporal gyrus, and the left precuneus (p < 0.001,
FDR corrected). Forced versus free condition showed activations in the
left inferior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and the bilateral inferior
parietal lobule (p < 0.001, FDR corrected) (see Table 3 and Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
By controlling for both morpho-syntactic and visual confounds, the
current fMRI study using picture naming examined the noun-verb dissociation
under forced and free naming conditions. When action
naming was compared to object naming, significant activations were
observed in the left hemishpere, including the precental gyrus, supplementary
motor area, insula, thalamus, middle cingulate gyrus, and
the bilateral middle temporal cortices. The verb-specific activation
engaged the motor system irrespective of the naming conditions while
no significant activations were observed when object naming was
compared to action naming. These results from neurologically intact
participants were in line with those of Péran and colleagues’ study on
action-verb processing in PD patients (2009), offering complementary
evidence for the role of the motor system in the processing of action
verbs. With regard to the naming conditions, naming under free condition
compared to naming under forced condition elicited fronto-

parietal cortex, suggesting the engagement of cognitive control
(MacDonald, Cohen, Stenger, & Carter, 2000).
The role of the motor system in action naming has been brought into
discussion in lesion-based studies (e.g., Chow, Brambati, Gorno-
Tempini, Miller, & Johnson, 2010; Cotelli et al., 2007, in press, 2006;
Péran et al., 2009). For example, using fMRI, Péran et al. (2009) reported
positive correlations between the severity of the motor deficits
and brain activities in motor-related brain regions when PD patients
conducted picture naming tasks. A voxel-based morphometry study on
the naming ability of patients with Corticobasal Syndrome and Progressive
Supranuclear Palsy revealed a correlation between left premotor
atrophy and action-related object naming (Chow et al., 2010).
Moreover, a deficit on measures involving action knowledge but not
object knowledge in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis was
also observed to correlate with motor cortex atrophy (Grossman et al.,
2008). In the current study, the verb-specific activations with picture
naming tasks in neurologically intact participants may offer complementary
evidence to those lesion-based studies which claimed a
close link between language deficits and motor impairment. Thus,
evidence from both the current study and language production deficits
in patients with movement disorders seem to point to the role of the
motor system in the processing of action verbs.
Studies on non-brain-damaged participants also show the engagement
of the motor and premotor cortices in the processing of actionrelated
words (Hauk et al., 2004; Martin, Wiggs, Ungerleider, & Haxby,
1996; Pulvermüller, 2005). Neuroimaging studies observed the activation
of motor system during speech sound perception (e.g.,
Pulvermüller et al., 2006; Wilson & Iacoboni, 2006; Wilson, Saygin,
Sereno, & Iacoboni, 2004). Likewise, action verbs were reported to
evoke significant responses in motor and/or premotor cortices in
comprehension tasks such as reading (Hauk et al., 2004), passive listening
(Raposo, Moss, Stamatakis, & Tyler, 2009), semantic judgment
(Kemmerer, Castillo, Talavage, Patterson, & Wiley, 2008) and lexical
judgment (De Grauwe, Willems, Rueschemeyer, Lemhöfer, & Schriefers,
2014). An fMRI experiment in healthy participants demonstrated that
semantic representations of action verbs and mental representations of
action were subserved by partially overlapping brain networks (Péran
et al., 2010). In a recent review, Kemmerer (2015) have even suggested
that the motor features of verb meanings are represented in the precentral
motor cortices.

Notably, evidence for a language-motor link mainly comes from
language perception and comprehension (for reviews see Fischer &
Zwaan, 2008; Pulvermüller & Fadiga, 2010; Willems & Hagoort, 2007).
However, fMRI studies with picture naming in non-brain-damaged
participants have provided limited supports for the engagement of the
motor system in the processing of verbs. Absence of direct evidence
from studies with picture naming paradigms may be owed to the
greater processing demands for morpho-syntactic, semantic or/and visual
processing separately or jointly. For example, it is well-documented
that the left inferior frontal gurys (IFG) plays a critical role in
verb processing (e.g., Cappa & Perani, 2003; Shapiro & Caramazza,
2003a; Shapiro et al., 2006; Silveri & Ciccarelli, 2007; Vigliocco et al.,
2011). However, some lesions studies on patients with verb impairment
did not show lesions within the left IFG (e.g., Aggujaro, Crepaldi,
Pistarini, Taricco, & Luzzatti, 2006; Silveri, Perri, & Cappa, 2003;
Tranel et al., 2005). In both some neuroimaging studies in healthy
participants (e.g., Siri et al., 2008; Vigliocco et al., 2006) and the current
study, no verb-minus-noun activations were observed in this area.
It is likely that verb-specific activation in the left IFG does not reflect
verb processing per se, but greater processing demands (Mätzig et al.,
2009; Vigliocco et al., 2011).
Using naming languages rich in inflectional morphology, some
studies showed the noun-verb differences in morpho-syntactic processing
during picture naming under phrasal (Siri et al., 2008) or sentential
contexts (Momenian et al., 2016; Siri et al., 2008). Despite that different
morpho-syntactic processes between nouns and verbs have been taken
as one of the origins of noun-verb dissociation (Shapiro & Caramazza,
2003a, 2003b; Shapiro et al., 2000), the semantic distinction between

object nouns and action verbs seems to offer a more plausible account
for the origin of noun-verb dissociation and verb-specific activations in
the current study. Here, participants named pictures in a language with
minimal inflectional morphology and did so out of phrasal or sentential
contexts. Thus, when action naming was compared to object naming,
the BOLD responses related to motor processing cannot be ascribed to
the morpho-syntactic difference but to the semantic difference between
the processing of object nouns and action verbs.
Chinese is a language with virtually no inflectional morphology
(Bates et al., 1991), thus providing a desirable alternative to rule out
morpho-syntactic processing demands in the study of noun-verb distinction.
To minimize the morpho-syntactic confounds, several fMRI
studies with lexical (Li, Jin, & Tan, 2004) or semantic (Yu, Bi, Han, Zhu,
& Law, 2012; Yu et al., 2011) judgment tasks investigated the neural
substrates underlying the processing of nouns and verbs in Chinese.
Those fMRI studies with comprehension tasks offered insights into the
processing of nouns and verbs in Chinese. However, there have been no
fMRI studies which addressed the noun-verb distinction using picture
naming in Chinese. Only several behavioral studies examined word
class effects with picture naming tasks in Chinese aphasic patients
(Bates et al., 1991; Bi, Han, Shu, & Caramazza, 2005; Law, Kong, Lai, &
Lai, 2015). In those behavioral studies, two sets of pictorial stimuli
(e.g., object pictures and action pictures) were used. As mentioned
above, the use of two pictorial datasets may result in confounds from
visual processing demands (Liljeström et al., 2008; Siri et al., 2008).
Using Chinese as the naming language and the same set of pictorial
stimuli for object naming or action naming, the current study could in a
way lessen confounds from morpho-syntactic and visual processing
demands.
Similar to some fMRI studies which used a set of pictures for naming
to lessen visual confounds (Hernandez et al., 2001; Liljeström et al.,
2008; Siri et al., 2008), the current study used the same set of pictorial
stimuli for object naming or action naming. Whereas those studies used
a set of action pictures for naming which, as aforementioned, may lead
to naming uncertainties for objects (e.g., “to light (the candle) vs.
“candle”, “hand”, “match’, and “flame”), the current study used a set of
object pictures for naming objects or actions performed on/with the
objects (e.g., bike-ride) (Péran et al., 2009). In this way, there were no
response uncertainties for object naming. However, naming uncertainties
arose for actions (e.g., door-open/close). To solve this problem
of naming uncertainties in the current study, participants were
asked to familiarize with the action concepts during the practice session
and remain consistent in concept naming throughout the experiment
(Liljeström et al., 2008). Notably, the difference in naming uncertainties
between our study and those studies was that the uncertainties
in the former resulted from idiosyncratic action concepts
which first came into one’s mind whereas the uncertainties in the latter
from differential visual analyses.
Apart from the motor and premotor cortices, our results also showed
verb-specific subcortical activation in the left thalamus and insula. The
potential role of subcortical areas in action-verb processing is worth
particular attention. Actually, it has been suggested that action-language
networks are dependent on cortical-subcortical integration
(Cardona et al., 2013). The thalamic activation is widely observed in
language production and comprehension tasks (for a review see Llano,
2013). The insular activation has been observed in word generation,
naming, phonological discrimination and auditory processing (for a
meta-analysis see Ardila, Bernal, & Rosselli, 2014).
The main effect of naming conditions showed the involvement of
the motor system during action naming relative to object naming
whereas no significant activation was observed during object naming
relative to action naming, consistent with the results of studies which
showed verb-specific activation whereas no significant activation for
nouns was observed (e.g., Berlingeri et al., 2008; Crescentini, Shallice,
& Macaluso, 2010; Damasio et al., 2001; Kable, Lease-Spellmeyer, &
Chatterjee, 2002; Momenian et al., 2016; Perani et al., 1999; Tyler &
Moss, 2001). Crepaldi et al. (2011) have postulated that action pictures
unavoidably included the representation of objects and agents involved
in the action. Similarly, in the current study, action naming unavoidably
involved the presentation of a corresponding object because
an action was performed on/with the object (e.g., When the pictorial
stimulus “pen” was presented, the naming of the action “to write”,
which was performed with an instrument, would surely involve the
representation of the object “pen”). As a result, action naming elicited

motor-related brain activity compared to object naming, whereas the
opposite comparison showed no significant activations.
When it came to the (free vs. forced) naming conditions, our fMRI
results showed that action naming relative to object naming engaged
the left motor/premotor cortices, thalamus and insula, independent of
free (internally motivated) or forced (externally elicited) naming conditions.
The verb-specific cortical-subcortical activation irrespective of
free or forced naming conditions offered further supports for the role of
the motor system in the processing of action verbs. However, reduced
verb-specific activation was observed under free naming conditions
relative to forced naming conditions. Moreover, in terms of error rates,
improved behavioral performance was also observed for free naming.
Previous studies reported behavioral performance benefits and/or reduced
brain activations in word production and language switching
under free conditions compared to under forced conditions (Blanco-
Elorrieta & Pylkkänen, 2017; Crosson et al., 2001; Tremblay & Gracco,
2006; Zhang et al., 2015). The ease of naming a picture as an object or
an action on one’s free will and the effortful naming as required may
reflect automatic versus controlled processing. Naming under free
conditions may have a clinical implication for patient-friendly assessment
of language production abilities.
In addition, our fMRI results showed elevated brain activities in the
frontal-parietal cortex under free naming conditions compared to under
forced naming conditions, well in line with findings of fMRI studies on
free language selection (Zhang et al., 2015) and free task selection (Orr
& Banich, 2014). The frontal-parietal function is generally believed to
involve executive control (MacDonald et al., 2000). Thus, significant
activations in the frontal-parietal cortex on free naming trials relative to
on forced naming trials suggested the engagement of cognitive control
mechanisms when participants had freedom to produce an intended
object or action concept. On the other hand, forced naming trials relative
to free naming trials elicited brain activations in the left inferior
frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus, two regions which were thought to
involve inhibition processing or attentional control when participants
were externally directed to conduct cognitive tasks (Garavan, Ross,
Murphy, Roche, & Stein, 2002; Swick, Ashley, & Turken, 2008; Zhang,
Feng, Fox, Gao, & Tan, 2004).
Taken together, the processing disadvantage of verbs may be ascribed
to the greater cognitive demands for morpho-syntactic or semantic
processing, and for visual analysis in the case of picture-naming
studies, in a separate or jointed way. By minimizing morpho-syntactic
and visual-spatial confounds, the current fMRI study has provided
evidence for the dissociation between nouns and verbs along semantic
dimensions. The evidence has lent supports for a semantic view that the
noun-verb dissociation is in fact a reflection of an underlying conceptual
deficit disproportionately affecting either object or action
concepts (Berlingeri et al., 2008; Crepaldi et al., 2011; Pulvermüller
et al., 1999; Vigliocco et al., 2011). The semantic view of the noun-verb
dissociation within conceptual system therefore could be generalized
across languages. However, the current study does not defy the
morpho-syntactic origin of noun-verb dissociation. In fact, lexical categories
are prototype notions with fussy boundaries, grounded in semantic
and morpho-syntactic dimensions (Givón, 1984). While the semantic
dimension is language-general, the morpho-syntactic dimension
is language-specific. Thus, although both of the two dimensions are at
interplay, semantics is the basic origin of noun-verb dissociation.
Converging neuroimaging evidence from studies on brain-damaged
patients and non-brain-damaged participants pinpoints to the role of
the motor system in action naming, suggesting a link between action
word processing and motor system (e.g., Chow et al., 2010; Cotelli
et al., 2007, in press, 2006; Hauk et al., 2004; Péran et al., 2009;
Pulvermüller, 2005). Specifically, verbs are semantically more demanding
of cognitive resources, as shown by the engagement of the
cortical-subcortical motor system in the processing of action verbs. Our
behavioral results showed that action naming was overall slower than
object naming in response latencies. Moreover, action naming had
overall higher error rates than object naming. Our behavioral results
were consistent with those of studies in aphasic patients (for a review
see Mätzig et al., 2009) and in neurologically intact participants using
picture naming (e.g., Bogka et al., 2003; Cotelli et al., 2012; Szekely
et al., 2005). Therefore, the processing disadvantage for verbs, namely
slower response latencies and higher error rates, may be accounted for
by additional cognitive demands for processing the motor aspects of
action verbs. Similarly, greater vulnerability of verbs in brain damage
can be ascribed to the coupling of language deficits and motor impairment.
One of limitations in the current study is an absence of clinical
patient samples. Findings from studies of both patients with brain damage
and neurologically intact participants will provide converging
and complementary evidence for the role of the motor system in the
processing of action verbs. Notably, within semantics, heterogeneity of
the semantic references of object-noun or action-verb stimuli can be a
major confounding factor that results in conflicting findings. For example,
there has been evidence showing dissociation between agentand
theme-body verbs in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Cousins, Ash,
& Grossman, in press). Future studies need to consider finer-grained
categories within both the object and the action sets.
